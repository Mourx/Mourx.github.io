      <h1>Butternut Squash Pasta</h1>
      <p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2><br>

        ½ butternut squash<br>
        1 Tbsp (15 mL) olive oil<br>
        ⅛ tsp salt<br>
        1 pinch ground black pepper<br>
        1 head garlic<br>

        <b>Pasta</b><br>
        14 oz (400 g) dry rigatoni<br>
        1 Tbsp (15 mL) olive oil<br>
        ½ cup (23 g) sage leaves, sliced<br>
        1 cup (240 mL) soy cooking cream<br>
        ½ lemon, juiced<br>
        1 cup (20 g) arugula<br>


      </p>
      <p>
        Preheat oven to 390°F (200°C) and line a baking tray. <br>
        Carefully peel the outer skin of the squash, or keep it on for extra fibre. <br>
        Cut the butternut squash in half lengthwise. <br>
        Use a spoon to scrape out the seeds and stringy bits and place these into a bowl of water.<br>
        <br>
        Thinly slice the squash into ½ cm thick slices. <br>
        Transfer to the baking tray, toss in oil, and sprinkle on some salt and pepper.<br>
        <br>
        Cut the top ½ cm off a head of garlic to expose the cloves. <br>
        Drizzle some oil on the garlic and place this on the baking tray as well. <br>
        Bake the garlic and squash for 20 minutes.<br>
        <br>
        Returning to the seeds in water, gently pick out the seeds and discard the stringy bits. <br>
        Then drain and rinse the seeds until clean. <br>
        Toss the seeds in a bit of oil, together with a sprinkle of salt and pepper to taste.<br>
        <br>
        Remove the baking tray from the oven. <br>
        Remove the head of garlic from the tray, and add in its place the squash seeds. <br>
        Flip over the squash slices and return to the ovenfor another 10 - 15 minutes, or until the seeds are lightly golden, and the squash is thoroughly cooked.<br>
        <br>
        Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water. <br>
        Cook until tender but not quite done - about 1 minute away from being al dente.<br>
        <br>
        Meanwhile, heat a large pan on medium-high heat and add the oil and sage. <br>
        Cook for 1 - 2 minutes, or until the sage shrivels. Add in the roasted garlic cloves, and mash with the back of a wooden spatula to purée it.<br>
        <br>
        Scoop out ¾ cup (180 mL) of the pasta cooking water and add it to the pan. <br>
        Then drain the pasta, and add this to the pan as well, along with the cooking cream. <br>
        Cook for a minute until heated through.<br>
        <br>
        Stir through the lemon juice, and plate while hot. <br>
        Top with arugula, baked squash, and crispy squash seeds. Enjoy!<br>
