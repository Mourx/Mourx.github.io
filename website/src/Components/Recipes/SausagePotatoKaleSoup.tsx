        Preheat a large stock pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. <br></br>
        Using a paring knife, make a shallow incision along the length of the
        sausage. <br></br>
        Peel back the casings and discard them.<br></br>
        <br></br>
        Add the olive oil to the pot and heat until shimmering. <br></br>
        Add the sausage and break it apart into 1" pieces with a wooden spoon.{" "}
        <br></br>
        Cook, stirring occasionally, until browned all over, around 8 minutes.{" "}
        <br></br>
        Reserve the fat in the pan, transfer the sausage to a bowl and set
        aside.<br></br>
        <br></br>
        Add the celery, carrots and leeks and season with a pinch of salt.{" "}
        <br></br>
        Cook, stirring, until the vegetables are soft and translucent, 10-12
