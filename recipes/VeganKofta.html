        1/2 a Red onion, grated<br>
        4 Cloves Garlic, grated<br>
        1 Tablespoon Fresh dill, chopped<br>
        1 Tablespoon Fresh mint, chopped<br>
        1 teaspoon Cumin<br>
        1 teaspoon Oregano<br>
        1/2 teaspoon Cinnamon<br>
        1/2 teaspoon Salt<br>
        1/4 teaspoon Black pepper<br>
        6 Wooden skewers, soaked<br>
        <br>
        <b>Tzatziki Sauce</b><br>
        1 Cup Vegan Greek style yogurt<br>
        1 Cup Grated cucumber<br>
        1 Tablespoons Fresh dill<br>
        1 Tablespoons Fresh Mint<br>
        2 Cloves Garlic, grated<br>
        1 Tablespoon Lemon juice<br>
        1/2 teaspoon Lemon zest<br>
        1/2 teaspoon Salt<br>
        1/4 teaspoon Black pepper<br>
        1 teaspoon Za'atar seasoning(optional)<br>
        <br>
        <b>For Serving</b><br>
        Flatbread<br>
        Lettuce<br>
        Tomato<br>
        Hummus<br>

      </p>
      <p>
      Preheat the oven to 400 degrees(F).<br>
      In a large mixing bowl, add the vegan ground beef, grated onion and garlic, the fresh herbs and all the spices.<br>
      Mix everything together, so it is completely combined.<br>
      <br>
      Divide the kofta mixture into 6 equal portions.<br>
      Take one portion and wrap it around one of the skewers that you soaked.<br>
      Pressing around evenly so that is a cylinder up the skewer.<br>
      Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or sprayed with non-stick spray.<br>
      <br>
      Repeat with the remaining kofta mixture, placing all the skewers on the sheet pan.<br>
      Bake for 10-12 minutes or until they are nice and firm.<br>
      <br>
      While the kofta bakes, make the tzatziki. Add all the tzatziki ingredients to a medium sized mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Set in the fridge until ready to use.<br>
      Once the kofta has baked, remove from the oven and grill either on a grill pan or a grill for 1-2 minutes on each side, just to brown up. Or you can serve them as is, if you don't have a grill or grill pan.<br>
      Serve immediately with the tzatziki sauce, flatbread and veggies if desired.<br>
