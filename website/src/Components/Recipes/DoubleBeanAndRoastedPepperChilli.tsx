        Put the onions, celery and chopped peppers with the oil in your largest
        flameproof casserole dish or heavy-based saucepan, and fry gently over a
        low heat until soft but not coloured.<br></br>
        Drain both jars of peppers over a bowl to catch the juices. Put a
        quarter of the peppers into a food processor with the chipotle paste,
        vinegar, cocoa, dried spices and herbs. Whizz to a pur√©e, then stir into
        the softened veg and cook for a few mins.<br></br>
        Add the tomatoes and refried beans with 1 can water and the reserved
        pepper juice. Simmer for 1 hr until thickened, smoky and the tomato
        chunks have broken down to a smoother sauce.<br></br>
        At this stage you can cool and chill the sauce if making ahead.
        Otherwise add the kidney and black beans, and the remaining roasted
        peppers, cut into bite-sized pieces, then reheat. (This makes a large
        batch, so once the sauce is ready it might be easier to split it between
        two pans when you add the beans and peppers.) Once bubbling and the
        beans are hot, season to taste and serve.<br></br>
