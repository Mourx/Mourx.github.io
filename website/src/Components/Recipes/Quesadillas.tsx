        STEP 1 <br></br>
        Heat the oil in a large frying pan and cook the onion and garlic for 2
        mins. <br></br>
        Add the cumin and cook for 1 min more. <br></br>
        Tip in the beans, paprika and a splash of water.<br></br>
        Using a potato masher, break the beans down as they warm through to make
        a rough purée. <br></br>
        Season generously.<br></br>
        <br></br>
        STEP 2<br></br>
        Spread the refried beans onto 4 of the tortillas and scatter over the
        cheese and coriander.<br></br>
        Spoon over the salsa, then top with the remaining tortillas to make 4
        sandwiches. <br></br>
        Wipe the frying pan with kitchen paper and return to the heat or heat a
        griddle pan. <br></br>
        Cook each sandwich for 1-2 mins on each side until the tortillas are
        crisp and golden and the cheese is melting. <br></br>
        Serve warm, cut into wedges, with extra salsa and soured cream for
        dipping.<br></br>
