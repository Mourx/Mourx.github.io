      <h1>Quesadillas</h1>
      <p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2><br>
        1 tbsp sunflower oil<br>
        1 onion, finely chopped<br>
        2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
        1 tsp cumin seeds<br>
        400g can pinto or kidney beans, rinsed and drained<br>
        2 tsp smoked paprika<br>
        8 flour tortillas<br>
        100g cheddar or gruyère, coarsely grated<br>
        Handful coriander leaves<br>
        200g tub fresh tomato salsa, plus extra to serve<br>
        Soured cream, to serve<br>

      </p>
      <p>

        <em><b>STEP 1</em></b> <br>
        Heat the oil in a large frying pan and cook the onion and garlic for 2 mins. <br>
        Add the cumin and cook for 1 min more. <br>
        Tip in the beans, paprika and a splash of water.<br>
        Using a potato masher, break the beans down as they warm through to make a rough purée. <br>
        Season generously.<br>
        <br>
        <em><b>STEP 2</em></b><br>
        Spread the refried beans onto 4 of the tortillas and scatter over the cheese and coriander.<br>
        Spoon over the salsa, then top with the remaining tortillas to make 4 sandwiches. <br>
        Wipe the frying pan with kitchen paper and return to the heat or heat a griddle pan. <br>
        Cook each sandwich for 1-2 mins on each side until the tortillas are crisp and golden and the cheese is melting. <br>
        Serve warm, cut into wedges, with extra salsa and soured cream for dipping.<br>
