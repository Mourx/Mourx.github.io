      <h1>Green Risotto</h1>
      <p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2><br>

        5 cups stock/broth<br>
        1 10-ounce bag spinach, tough stems removed<br>
        1 cup fresh basil leaves<br>
        2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br>
        1 cup chopped shallots or onion<br>
        4 cloves garlic, minced<br>
        1 ½ cups arborio, carnaroli or other risotto rice<br>
        ¼ teaspoon salt<br>
        1 cup dry white wine(optional)<br>
        1 cup finely shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, divided<br>
        Freshly ground pepper to taste<br>
        1/3 cup toasted pine nuts (see Tip)<br>


      </p>
      <p>

        Bring broth to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.<br>
        Reduce the heat so the broth remains steaming, but is not simmering.<br>
        <br>

        Rinse spinach thoroughly with cold water and place in a large microwave-safe bowl.<br>
        Cover with plastic wrap and punch several holes in it.<br>
        Microwave on High until wilted, 2 to 3 minutes.<br>
        Let cool, then squeeze out excess moisture.<br>
        Transfer to a food processor or blender, add basil and puree until smooth; set aside.<br>
        <br>

        Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-low heat.<br>
        Add shallots (or onion) and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 2 minutes.<br>
        Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.<br>
        Add rice and salt and stir to coat.<br>
        <br>

        Stir 1/2 cup of the hot broth and a generous splash of wine into the rice.<br>
        Cook, stirring frequently, until the liquid has been absorbed.<br>
        Continue to cook on medium-low, adding broth in 1/2-cup increments followed by a splash of wine, and stirring frequently after each addition, until most of the liquid is absorbed.<br>
        The risotto is done when you've used all the broth and wine and the rice is creamy and just tender, 25 to 35 minutes total.<br>
        Stir in the reserved spinach-basil puree.<br>
        <br>

        Remove from the heat; stir in 3/4 cup cheese and pepper.<br>
        Serve sprinkled with pine nuts and the remaining 1/4 cup cheese.<br>
