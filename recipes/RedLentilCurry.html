      <h1>Red Lentil Curry</h1>
      <p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2><br>

        <b>For the Red Lentil Curry:</b><br>
        2 tablespoons coconut oil (or olive oil)<br>
        1 large onion, peeled and chopped<br>
        2 cups diced carrots<br>
        3-4 cloves garlic, minced<br>
        2 tablespoons fresh grated ginger<br>
        2+ tablespoons thai red curry paste<br>
        2 teaspoons ground cumin<br>
        1 teaspoon salt<br>
        16 ounce dried red lentils<br>
        6 cups vegetable broth<br>
        15 ounce can crushed tomatoes<br>
        14 ounce can unsweetened coconut milk<br>
        <b>For the Pickled Onions:</b><br>
        1/2 red onion, sliced<br>
        1/2 cup water<br>
        1/4 cup apple cider vinegar<br>
        1 tablespoon palm sugar (or your preferred sweetener)<br>
        1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
        <b>Additional Garnishes:</b><br>
        1 cup cashews<br>
        1 cup cilantro<br>

      </p>
      <p>

        For the Pickled Onions: In a small microwave-safe bowl mix the water, vinegar, sugar, and salt. Microwave for 60-90 seconds to dissolve the sugar. Slice the onions thin. Then mix them into the pickling water. Allow them to soak as you make the lentil curry.<br><br>
        For the Red Lentil Curry: Chop the onions, carrots, garlic and grate the ginger. Set a large 6-8 quart pot over medium heat. Add the oil.<br><br>
        Once hot, add the onions, carrots, garlic, ginger, 2-5 tablespoons curry paste, cumin, and salt. Saute until the onions are soft and tender. *If your curry paste tastes/smells very spicy, add only 2 tablespoons. You can always add more later.<br><br>
        Pour in the dried red lentils, chicken broth, crushed tomatoes, and coconut milk. Stir well. Simmer for 20 minutes, stirring every 3-5 minutes, so the lentils don't stick to the bottom of the pot.<br><br>
        If the liquid seems to absorb before the lentils are fully cooked, add some water to loosen up the mixture. After 20 minutes, the lentil curry should be soft and thick.<br><br>
        Drain the pickled onions. Serve the lentil curry warm, on its own, with rice, or with baby spinach. Top with pickled onions, cashews, and cilantro leaves.<br><br>
