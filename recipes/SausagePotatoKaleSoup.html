      <h1>Sausage, Potato, and Kale Soup</h1>
      <p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2><br>

        2 tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive Oil<br>
        4 Italian sausages (spicy, medium or mild), casings removed and discarded<br>
        2 celery stalks diced<br>
        2 carrots diced<br>
        1 leek thinly sliced, substitute 1 yellow onion<br>
        2 cloves garlic thinly sliced<br>
        1.5 teaspoon sweet Spanish paprika<br>
        1 teaspoon dried chili flakes optional<br>
        1.5 quart chicken stock<br>
        5 small red potatoes cubed<br>
        2 bay leaves<br>
        1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves<br>
        1 head kale roughly chopped into ribbons<br>
        2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh parsley<br>
        Kosher salt and black pepper to taste<br>


      </p>
      <p>
        Preheat a large stock pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. <br>
        Using a paring knife, make a shallow incision along the length of the sausage. <br>
        Peel back the casings and discard them.<br>
        <br>
        Add the olive oil to the pot and heat until shimmering. <br>
        Add the sausage and break it apart into 1" pieces with a wooden spoon. <br>
        Cook, stirring occasionally, until browned all over, around 8 minutes. <br>
        Reserve the fat in the pan, transfer the sausage to a bowl and set aside.<br>
        <br>
        Add the celery, carrots and leeks and season with a pinch of salt. <br>
        Cook, stirring, until the vegetables are soft and translucent, 10-12 minutes. <br>
        Add the garlic and cook, stirring, 60 seconds. <br>
        Add the paprika and chile flakes, if using, and cook, stirring, 60 seconds.<br>
        <br>
        Add the stock, potatoes, browned sausage, bay leaves and thyme and stir to combine. <br>
        Bring the soup to a simmer, cover with a lid, reduce the heat to medium and cook until the potatoes are fork-tender, 12 to 14 minutes.<br>
        <br>
        Add the kale and cook 3-4 minutes or until wilted to desired texture. <br>
        Taste the soup for seasoning and adjust with salt and pepper as desired. <br>
        If the soup is too salty or thick, add Â½ cup of water at a time until you reach your desired consistency and taste.<br>
        <br>
        Add the parsley and stir to combine. Ladle the soup into individual serving bowls and enjoy!<br>
