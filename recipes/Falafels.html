        5000g dried chickpeas <br>
        1 brown onion<br>
        3 garlic cloves<br>
        Fresh Coriander<br>
        Fresh parsley<br>
        Plain flour<br>
        Ground Cumin<br>
        Cayenne pepper<br>
        Olive oil<br>
        <b>Salad</b><br>
        4-6 tomatoes<br>
        1 cucumber<br>

      Pour the dried chickpeas into a bowl, cover with warm water and soak overnight</b>
      <br>
      Preheat the oven to 180C.<br>
      Start with the falafel mix. Add the soaked, dried chickpeas, a chopped brown onion, the garlic cloves, a large handful of coriander, a large handful of parsley, 2 tbsp of flour, 2 tsp of cumin and 1 tsp of cayenne pepper into a blender.<br>
      Season with salt and pepper.<br>
      <br>
      Pulse the mixture in a blender. <br> You want the texture to be rough so don't overdo it.<br>
      Pulsing 3-4 times for 5 seconds each time should do the trick.<br>
      Check teh falafel misture can stick in a ball. If it is too loose, just a dd a bit more flour.<br>
      <br>
      Make little discs, around 4cm wide, and 3cm deep.<br>
      Line them up on a sheet of baking paper, and put them in the fridge for 10 miuntes to firm up. <br>
      The mixture should make about 20 discs.<br>
      <br>
      Salad time. Chop the tomatoes, peel the cucumber and chop it into chunks, and add to a bowl.<br>
      Add a handful of chopped mint, a handful of chopped parsley, the juice of a lemon, salt, pepper, and a glug of olive oil.<br>
      Mix.<br>
      <br>
      Falafel time. Line a baking sheet with baking paper, and place your falafel on it.<br>
      Drizzle lightly with olive oil on one side,and then turn over the falafel and drizzle olive oil on the other side.<br>
      Pat in the oil with your fingers, and then place in the hot oven for 30 minutes, flipping the falafel after 20 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      Serve with warm pitta bread and hummus.<br>
