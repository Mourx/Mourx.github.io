        Wash the rice in a few changes of cold water until it runs clear, then
        leave to soak in cold water for 20 minutes. <br></br>
        Drain the rice, put into a large lidded saucepan and pour over the
        stock. <br></br>
        Bring to the boil, then cover the pan, turn the heat down to a whisper
        and leave to cook for 10 to 12 minutes.<br></br>
        Take off the heat and leave the rice, still covered, to steam through
        until needed.<br></br>
        <br></br>
        Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large, lidded pan on a medium flame.
        <br></br>
        Once hot, add the onions and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, until translucent
        and softening but not yet coloured.<br></br>
        Add the garlic and chillies, cook for another 2 minutes, then stir in
        the fennel and a couple of tablespoons of water, and ccover the pan.
        <br></br>
        Leave to cook for 8 minutes, until soft, then add the asparagus, peas,
        broad beans, cumin, garam masala, and salt.<br></br>
        Stir, c over again, cook for 3 to 5 minutes more, then take off the
        heat.<br></br>
        <br></br>
        Finely chop the herbs and fold them and the rice into the vegetable
        mixture - you might need to break up any clumps of rice delicately with
        your hands - then transfer to a serving dish and serve with wedges of
        lemon on the side.
