        1 tsp dried oregano<br>
        1 tsp dried thyme<br>
        1 tsp fennel seeds<br>
        150g/5½oz brown basmati rice<br>
        1 bay leaf<br>
        400g tin chopped tomatoes<br>
        2 vegetable stock cubes, crumbled<br>

        If you’re using dried kidney beans, drain the soaked beans in a colander, rinse thoroughly, then tip into a saucepan and cover with plenty of fresh cold water. Bring to the boil and cook at a rapid boil for 10 minutes, then reduce the heat and simmer gently for 1–2 hours, until soft. Drain, then set aside to cool.<br>

        Heat a splash of oil in a wide casserole over a medium-low heat and fry the onion and garlic gently for 5 minutes until soft. Add the smoked paprika, herbs and fennel seeds, fry for 30 seconds more, then stir in the rice.<br>

        Add the bay leaf, cooked (or tinned) beans, chopped tomatoes, stock cubes and boiling water and bring to a simmer. Cover with a lid and cook for 25 minutes.<br>

        Stir in the frozen vegetables, cover with a lid and remove from the heat. Leave to stand for 5 minutes or until the vegetables are warmed through.<br>
