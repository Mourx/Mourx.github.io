      <h1>Vegetable Enchiladas</h1>
      <p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2><br>

        2 red or yellow peppers<br>
        2 corn on the cob<br>
        Olive oil<br>
        1 x 400g tin black beans<br>
        ½ teaspoon ground cumin<br>
        6 spring onions<br>
        1 fresh red chilli<br>
        1 bunch of fresh coriander , (30g)<br>
        1 lime<br>
        2 cloves of garlic<br>
        1 x 400g tin quality plum tomatoes<br>
        8 small corn tortillas<br>
        70 g mature Cheddar cheese<br>
        40 g feta cheese<br>


      </p>
      <p>
        Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6.<br>
        Place a griddle pan over a high heat to get smoking hot.<br>
        <br>
        Halve and deseed the peppers, then add to the griddle with the corn.<br>
        Grill for 8 to 10 minutes, or until charred and bar-marked, turning occasionally.<br>
        Remove to a plate to cool.<br>
        <br>
        Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a medium frying pan over a medium heat.<br>
        Drain and add the black beans, stir in the cumin and fry for 4 to 5 minutes, or until crisp, stirring occasionally.<br>
        <br>
        Once cooled, cut the corn kernels away from the cob and chop the peppers into 1.5cm chunks. <br>
        Reserving 1 tablespoon of the corn, add to a large bowl with the peppers and black beans.<br>
        <br>
        Trim, finely slice and add the spring onions, reserving a small handful to one side. <br>
        Deseed, finely slice and add the chilli. <br>
        Pick and add most of the coriander leaves, reserving the stalks.<br>
        <br>
        Squeeze in the lime juice and season well with sea salt and black pepper.<br>
        <br>
        Wipe the frying pan clean with kitchen paper, then return to a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of oil.<br>
        <br>
        Peel and finely slice the garlic and finely slice the coriander stalks, then add to the pan for 1 minute.<br>
        <br>
        Stir in the tomatoes and ½ a tin’s worth of hot water, breaking up the tomatoes with the back of a wooden spoon. <br>
        Bring to the boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes, or until thickened and reduced.<br>
        <br>
        Season to taste, carefully transfer to a liquidiser and blitz until smooth.<br>
        <br>
        Divide the vegetable mixture between 8 corn tortillas and roll them up. <br>
        Line them up in a snug-fitting baking dish (roughly 20cm x 30cm), with the scruffy ends tucked underneath.<br>
        <br>
        Pour over the tomato sauce, coarsely grate the Cheddar on top and crumble over the feta.<br>
        Drizzle with a little oil, then pop in the hot oven for 25 minutes, or until bubbling and golden.<br>
        <br>
        Serve scattered with the reserved corn, spring onion and coriander leaves. <br>
        Delicious with a crisp green salad.<br>
