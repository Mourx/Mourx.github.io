      <h1>Lentil Shepherd's Pie</h1>
      <p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2><br>

        <b>Lentil Filling</b><br>
        1 tablespoon olive oil<br>
        3 large yellow onions, diced<br>
        8 cloves garlic minced (use less if you’re not a huge fan of garlic)<br>
        1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, roughly chopped<br>
        2 teaspoons fresh rosemary leaves, roughly chopped<br>
        3 tablespoons tomato paste<br>
        1/2 cup (120 mL) dry red wine<br>
        1 1/2 cups (10 ounces / 285g) green lentils (or brown lentils)<br>
        3 3/4 cups (900 mL) vegetable broth<br>
        2 bay leaves<br>
        1 1/2 teaspoons sweet or hot paprika<br>
        1/4 cup (56g) smooth tahini**<br>
        1 tablespoon tamari (or soy sauce)<br>
        1 tablespoon good-quality balsamic vinegar<br>
        2 teaspoons vegan Worcestershire sauce (optional)<br>
        Plenty of kosher salt or sea salt (I used 1 1/2 – 2 teaspoons kosher salt)<br>
        Freshly cracked black pepper to taste<br>

        <b>Mashed Potato Topping</b><br>
        20 ounces (680g) Russet potatoes<br>
        16 ounces (454g) cauliflower, cut into large florets<br><br>
        1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste<br>
        1 rosemary sprig (optional)<br>
        4 tablespoons vegan butter, softened at room temperature (or olive oil)<br>
        1/2 cup (120 mL) “lite” coconut milk<br>
        1 tablespoon nutritional yeast<br>
        Freshly cracked black pepper to taste<br>

        <b>Optional finishes and garnishes</b><br>
        Extra virgin oil for baking and finishing<br>
        Flaky sea salt and black pepper<br>
        Fresh thyme leaves<br>
        Chopped flat-leaf parsley<br>


      </p>
      <p>
        Make the Lentil Filling. <br>
        Heat the olive oil in an ovenproof 12-inch skillet over medium to medium-high heat until hot. <br>
        If you don’t have an ovenproof skillet, you’ll need to transfer the cooked lentil filling to a baking dish when it’s time to bake.<br>
        <br>
        Add the onions with a couple pinches of salt and sauté for 8-10 minutes, or until most of the onions are browned. <br>
        Stir occasionally to prevent burning, but not too often so that they can brown. <br>
        Add the garlic, thyme and rosemary and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent burning.<br>
        <br>
        Push the onions to the edges of the pan so there’s an empty space in the middle of the pan. <br>
        Add the tomato paste into the empty space and stir for 2-3 minutes, or until it darkens in color. <br>
        Reduce the heat to medium, as needed.<br>
        <br>
        Pour in the red wine and deglaze the pan, stirring up any browned bits, until the liquid has mostly evaporated and the smell of alcohol has dissipated, about 3-4 minutes.<br>
        <br>
        Add the vegetable broth, along with the lentils, bay leaves, and paprika. <br>
        Stir to combine and increase the heat to bring to a boil. <br>
        Once boiling, reduce heat to maintain a rapid simmer, and simmer until the lentils are just tender and most of the liquid has been absorbed, 25-30 minutes.<br>
        <br>
        Turn the heat to low. <br>
        Add the tahini, tamari, balsamic vinegar, and vegan Worcestershire sauce (if using). <br>
        Stir until well incorporated. Taste for seasonings, adding a generous amount of salt (I used about 1 teaspoon kosher salt) and black pepper. <br>
        Set aside.<br>
        <br>
        Make the Mashed Potato Topping. <br>
        Peel the Russet potatoes and then rinse them under cold water. <br>
        Chop the potatoes into eighths.<br>
        <br>
        Place the potatoes and cauliflower florets in a large saucepan or Dutch oven and add just enough water to cover. <br>
        Add 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt and stir to combine. <br>
        Place the rosemary sprig on top. <br>
        Bring to a boil and cook until both potatoes and cauliflower are fork-tender and are very soft when poked, about 15 minutes.<br>
        <br>
        Thoroughly drain the potatoes and cauliflower in a colander and discard the rosemary sprig. <br>
        For the potatoes, pat them dry with paper towels or a clean dish towel. <br>
        For the cauliflower, you’ll need to squeeze out the excess water or it’ll be very watery.<br>
        <br>
        Return the vegetables to the saucepan or transfer them to a large bowl. <br>
        Add in the softened vegan butter, lite coconut milk, nutritional yeast, along with salt and black pepper to taste. <br>
        Mash together. <br>
        Taste for seasonings, adding more salt as needed.<br>
        <br>
        Assemble the Shepherd’s Pie. <br>
        Preheat the oven to 375°F/190°C. <br>
        If your skillet is ovenproof and has enough space, leave the Lentil Filling in there. <br>
        If not, transfer it to a large (3 quart/3 liter) baking dish. <br>
        Smooth the Lentil Filling out. <br>
        Then, spoon and carefully spread out the Mashed Potato Topping on top, covering the whole surface. <br>
        For more flavor, drizzle the top with extra virgin olive oil and some extra pinches of salt, pepper, and fresh thyme leaves.<br>
        <br>
        Bake for 20 minutes, or until the lentil filling starts to bubble up. <br>
        Remove from the oven and turn on your oven’s broiler. <br>
        Place the pan under the broiler for a few minutes until the crust is golden brown. <br>
        To finish, drizzle with more olive oil and garnish with fresh parsley, if desired.<br>
        <br>
        Note: if you want the pie to solidify more, allow it to rest for at least 20 minutes in the pan.<br>
        Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days.<br>
