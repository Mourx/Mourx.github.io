        Put the red kidney beans in a large saucepan, cover with cold water and
        let soak overnight. <br></br>
        Drain the soaked beans and return to the saucepan with double the amount
        of water. Bring to the boil, then keep boiling for 15 minutes. <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Reduce the heat to medium/low and simmer gently for 1 hour, or until the
        beans are tender. Drain, reserving the cooking liquid. <br></br>
        Heat the butter and oil in a large, heavy-based saucepan and add the
        onion, cinnamon, bay leaves, garlic, and ginger, and stri-fry for 4-5
        minutes.<br></br>
        Stir in the turmeric, ground coriander, garam masala, and chillies.{" "}
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Add the beans, tomato purée and enough of the reserved cooking liquid to
        make a thick sauce. Bring to the boil and cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring
        often. <br></br>
        Serve, with yoghurt if desired.<br></br>
