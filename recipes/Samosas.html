      <h1> Samosas</h1>
      <p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2><br>

        2 cups (250 g) all-purpose flour<br>
        1 tsp salt<br>
        ⅓ cup (100 ml) + 1 tbsp cold water<br>
        4 tbsp vegetable oil<br>
        <b>Filling:</b><br>
        10.5 oz (300 g) russet potatoes peeled and diced<br>
        1 tbsp oil for frying<br>
        1 onion chopped<br>
        2 garlic cloves minced<br>
        2 tsp ginger grated<br>
        1 tbsp curry powder I used garam masala<br>
        1 tsp cumin ground<br>
        1 tsp paprika powder or chili powder to taste<br>
        1 tsp turmeric optional<br>
        ½ cup (80 g) peas frozen and thawed<br>
        ½ (80 g) red bell pepper or green peppers, finely chopped<br>
        1 tsp salt or to taste<br>
        black pepper to taste<br>
        <b>For frying (or bake them, *see notes)</b><br>
        2 cups (480 ml) of vegetable oil<br>


      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Dough:</b><br>
        Whisk the flour and salt together in a bowl.<br>
        Pour in the cold water and oil, then mix with chopsticks until the flour has absorbed the liquid.<br>
        Mix the dough bits together with your hands, then transfer to a working surface.<br>
        Knead for 3-4 minutes until a smooth and soft dough forms (but avoid overworking).<br>
        Finally, form the dough into two balls, wrap each tightly in cling film and refrigerate for one hour.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Filling:</b><br>
        In the meantime, place the diced potatoes in a pot of salted water. <br>
        Drain and allow excess moisture to evaporate, then place in a bowl, and mash thoroughly with a potato masher or fork. <br>
        Bring to a boil and cook for about 10 minutes, or until fork-tender. <br>
        Set aside to cool completely.<br>
        <br>
        In a large pan, heat one tbsp of oil. Add the onions and sauté for 2-3 minutes until lightly browned.
        <br>Add the garlic, ginger, curry powder, cumin, paprika powder, and turmeric.
        <br>Sauté for another 30 seconds to develop flavors. Set aside.<br>
        <br>
        Once the potatoes have cooled to room temperature, add in the onion mixture, chopped bell peppers, and thawed peas. <br>
        Sprinkle salt and pepper to taste, stir to combine, and set aside.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Fold samosas:</b><br>
        After the chill time, remove one portion of the dough from the fridge. <br>
        Divide it into 8 pieces and form each piece into a ball. <br>
        Work with one small dough ball at a time and cover the rest with a damp cloth to prevent it from drying out.<br>
        <br>
        On a lightly floured work surface, roll out one small dough ball to a 6-inch (15 cm) circle. Cut it in half to form two half-moon shapes.<br>
        Take approx. 2 tbsp of the filling and press it together into a triangle shape. <br>
        Then place it onto the half-moon dough shaped dough you just cut (see step-by-step photos above). <br>
        Brush the outer edges with water, then fold one side of the dough over and around the filling to create a triangle/cone shape. <br>
        Pinch the edges together, make sure your samosas are well sealed. Place on a wooden board (be sure to leave enough space between each samosa to prevent them from sticking together) while you prepare the rest.<br>
        When all balls are wrapped into samosas, remove the second portion of the dough from the refrigerator, and continue this process to make more samosas.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Cook samosas:</b><br>
        Now you can fry or bake them. To fry, heat around 2 cups of oil in a deep pot or pan to 320-338°F (160-170°C). <br>
        Once hot, carefully drop the samosas and fry in batches until the samosas are golden-browned and crispy, turning occasionally (make sure not to overcrowd the pot.)<br>
        Remove from the pot and transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels (this will get rid of excess oil).<br>
        Finally, sprinkle the samosa with sesame seeds and serve with vegan raita, guacamole, or any dip of your choice. Enjoy!<br>
