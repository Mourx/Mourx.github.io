        Make sure to stir occasionally.<br>
        <br>
        Meanwhile, pick the pomegranate seeds. <br>
        Pick and roughly chop the flat leaf parsley, and toss them with the toasted flaked almonds, sour cherries, and pomegranate seeds.<br>

        When the onions are ready, stir through the cooked lentils, check the seasoning, and plate up. <br>
