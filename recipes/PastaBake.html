        <h2>Ingredients</h2><br>

        1 red pepper, seeds removed, cut into bite-size chunks<br>
        1 yellow pepper, seeds removed, cut into bite-size chunks<br>
        1 aubergine, finely chopped<br>
        1 courgette, finely chopped<br>
        1 red onion, sliced<br>
        3 tbsp olive oil<br>
        150g/5½oz cherry tomatoes, halved<br>
        400g tin chopped tomatoes<br>
        2 garlic cloves, crushed<br>
        3 tbsp roughly chopped basil<br>
        300g/10½oz pasta, such as gemelli or penne<br>
        150g/5½oz ball mozzarella, drained and finely chopped<br>
        2 tbsp pesto<br>
        2-3 tbsp finely grated Parmesan, or a vegetarian hard cheese alternative<br>
        salt and freshly ground black pepper<br>


      </p>
      <p>
        Preheat the oven to 190C/170C Fan/Gas 5.<br>
        <br>
        Put the peppers, aubergine, courgette and onion into a roasting tin or deep baking dish and coat in the oil. <br>
        Season with salt and pepper and cook for 45 minutes, turning twice, until the vegetables are tender and golden brown.<br>
        <br>
        Add the cherry tomatoes, chopped tomatoes, garlic and basil and cook for 10–15 minutes.<br>
        <br>
        Meanwhile, cook the pasta in boiling salted water according to pack instructions. <br>
        Add 4–6 tablespoons of the pasta cooking water to the vegetables to loosen the tomato sauce.<br>
        <br>
        Drain the pasta and stir into the roasted vegetables. <br>
        Stir through the mozzarella and pesto, top with Parmesan and return to the oven for another 10 minutes, until the cheese has melted.<br>
