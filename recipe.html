      <h1>Sweet and Crunchy Tofu</h1>
      <p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2><br>
        <em><b>Serves 4</b></em><br>

        2 cups vegetable oil for frying <br>
        14 ounces to 1 pound firm or medium firm tofu, cut into bite size pieces<br>
        ¼ cup potato starch <br>
        1 tablespoon pumpkin seeds (optional) <br>
        <br>
        <em><b>For seasoning sauce</b></em> <br>
        ¼ cup ketchup <br>
        ¼ cup rice syrup <br>
        3 tablespoons gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)<br>

      </p>
      <p>

        Combine all the seasoning sauce ingredients in a skillet. Heat over medium high heat, stirring for about 1 to 2 minutes until bubbling. Remove from the heat and set the skillet aside. We’ll reheat this just before serving. <br>
        <br><em><b>Coat the tofu</b> </em><br>

        Cut the tofu into 1 x 1½ inch bite sized pieces. Pat dry with kitchen towel or paper towel. <br>
        Gently put the tofu into a plastic bag and add the potato starch. Seal the bag and gently turn it over until the tofu is well and evenly coated with the starch. <br>
        Remove each piece from the bag individually and transfer to a large plate or a cutting board lined with plastic wrap, leaving some space between the pieces.<br>
        <br>
        <em><b>Fry the tofu </b> </em> <br>

        Heat the oil in a skillet for 5 minutes, until it reaches 330-340°F. Carefully add the tofu pieces one at a time to the hot oil. Turn the heat down to medium and let the tofu cook for about about 2 to 3 minutes, until the bottom turns light brown and the surface is a little crispy .<br>
        Turn the tofu pieces with tongs or a slotted spoon—they should be firm enough to turn without breaking—and fry for another 2 to 3 minutes, occasionally turning so that all sides turn light brown and crispy. Remove from the skillet and set in a wire mesh strainer set over a bowl.<br>
        <br>
        <em><b>… and then time to double-fry!</b></em><br>

        Reheat the oil for 1 minute over medium-high heat and fry all the tofu again for 3 to 4  minutes, rotating and turning them over with tongs or long wooden chopsticks, until all sides are golden brown and crunchy.<br>
        <br><em><b>Handle pumpkin seeds</b></em><br>
        Transfer the tofu to the strainer set over a bowl to drain the excess oil.<br>

        If you use pumpkin seeds, put them into a slotted spoon and dip them into the hot oil to fry them for just 10 seconds or so. Transfer the seeds to a small bowl and turn off the heat.<br>

        <br><em><b>Coat and serve</b></em><br>

        Reheat the sauce in the skillet until bubbling. Add the fried tofu and gently mix all together until they are well coated.<br>
        Transfer to a plate and sprinkle the pumpkin seeds over top. Serve as a side dish for rice.<br>
