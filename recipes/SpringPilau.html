      <h1>Spring Pilau</h1>
      <p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2><br>
        350g basmati rice <br>
        600ml vegan vegetable stock<br>
        3 tbsp olive oil<br>
        2 red onions<br>
        4 cloves of garlic<br>
        2 green finger chillies<br>
        1 medium fennel bulb<br>
        250g asparagus<br>
        200g (frozen) mixed peas and broad beans<br>
        1.5 tsp ground cumin<br>
        1.5 tsp garam masala<br>
        3/4 tsp salt<br>
        Handful fresh mint<br>
        Handful fresh dill<br>
        1 lemon<br>
        <br>

      </p>
      <p>
      Wash the rice in a few changes of cold water until it runs clear, then leave to soak in cold water for 20 minutes. <br>
      Drain the rice, put into a large lidded saucepan and pour over the stock. <br>
      Bring to the boil, then cover the pan, turn the heat down to a whisper and leave to cook for 10 to 12 minutes.<br>
      Take off the heat and leave the rice, still covered, to steam through until needed.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large, lidded pan on a medium flame.<br>
      Once hot, add the onions and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, until translucent and softening but not yet coloured.<br>
      Add the garlic and chillies, cook for another 2 minutes, then stir in the fennel and a couple of tablespoons of water, and ccover the pan.<br>
      Leave to cook for 8 minutes, until soft, then add the asparagus, peas, broad beans, cumin, garam masala, and salt.<br>
      Stir, c over again, cook for 3 to 5 minutes more, then take off the heat.<br>
      <br>
      Finely chop the herbs and fold them and the rice into the vegetable mixture - you might need to break up any clumps of rice delicately with your hands - then transfer to a serving dish and serve with wedges of lemon on the side.
