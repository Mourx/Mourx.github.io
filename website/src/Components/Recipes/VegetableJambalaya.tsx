        If you’re using dried kidney beans, drain the soaked beans in a
        colander, rinse thoroughly, then tip into a saucepan and cover with
        plenty of fresh cold water. Bring to the boil and cook at a rapid boil
        for 10 minutes, then reduce the heat and simmer gently for 1-2 hours,
        until soft. Drain, then set aside to cool.<br></br>
        Heat a splash of oil in a wide casserole over a medium-low heat and fry
        the onion and garlic gently for 5 minutes until soft. Add the smoked
        paprika, herbs and fennel seeds, fry for 30 seconds more, then stir in
        the rice.<br></br>
        Add the bay leaf, cooked (or tinned) beans, chopped tomatoes, stock
        cubes and boiling water and bring to a simmer. Cover with a lid and cook
        for 25 minutes.<br></br>
        Stir in the frozen vegetables, cover with a lid and remove from the
        heat. Leave to stand for 5 minutes or until the vegetables are warmed
        through.<br></br>
