      <h1>Red Kidney Bean Curry</h1>
      <p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2><br>

        250g dried red kidney beans <br>
        1 tbsp butter <br>
        2 tbsps oil <br>
        1 onion, chopped <br>
        cinnamon <br>
        2 dried bay leaves <br>
        3 garlic cloves <br>
        2 tsps grated ginger <br>
        1/2 tsp tumeric <br>
        1 tsp ground coriander <br>
        2 tsps ground cumin <br>
        1 tsp garam masala <br>
        2 dried red chillies <br>
        4 tbsp tomato purée <br>
        salt and pepper <br>
        yoghurt to drizzle (optional)<br>


      </p>
      <p>
        Put the red kidney beans in a large saucepan, cover with cold water and let soak overnight. <br>
        Drain the soaked beans and return to the saucepan with double the amount of water. Bring to the boil, then keep boiling for 15 minutes. <br>
        <br>
        Reduce the heat to medium/low and simmer gently for 1 hour, or until the beans are tender. Drain, reserving the cooking liquid. <br>
        Heat the butter and oil in a large, heavy-based saucepan and add the onion, cinnamon, bay leaves, garlic, and ginger, and stri-fry for 4-5 minutes.<br>
        Stir in the turmeric, ground coriander, garam masala, and chillies. <br>
        <br>
        Add the beans, tomato purée and enough of the reserved cooking liquid to make a thick sauce. Bring to the boil and cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring often. <br>
        Serve, with yoghurt if desired.<br>
