      <h1>Sweet Potato Tortilla</h1>
      <p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2><br>

        3 sweet potatoes<br>
        2 tbsp olive oil<br>
        100g baby spinach<br>
        6 large eggs<br>
        100g feta, crumbled<br>


      </p>
      <p>
        Pierce the potatoes a few times on each side. Microwave on high for 5-8 mins until soft, then set aside to cool a little.<br><br>


        Heat the oil in a 20cm ovenproof frying pan and wilt the spinach for a minute or two (you might have to do this in batches). Cut each potato in half lengthways and use a spoon to scoop out the flesh, keeping it in big chunks. Whisk the eggs.<br><br>


        Add the sweet potato to the pan and stir to combine with the spinach – don’t break it up too much. Pour in the egg and swirl around so it fills any gaps in the pan. Scatter over the feta and cook for 4-5 mins over a low heat until the bottom and sides are set.<br><br>


        Place under the grill for 1-2 mins to cook the top – poke a knife into the centre to ensure it’s cooked through. Cool before slicing into wedges. Will keep chilled for up to a day.<br><br>
