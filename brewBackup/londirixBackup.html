##### About Londirix

\pagebreakNum

## Focura
Focura is a continent at the centre of the world of Londirix, both geographically and culturally. Most other cultures have had dealings with those from Focura, from wars and trade agreements, to happening upon adventurers from the region

### Nations of Focura
<br>

#### The Unvariant Empire
Ruled by a council of ancient Elves, the Unvariant Empire is the largest nation in Focura, and covers most of the southern and western coastlines. They maintain a powerful military, but have no desire to expand, instead looking to preserve their great empire and wealth forever.

The population of the Empire is mixed, mostly between Elves and Humans, but other races of Focura are welcomed if they bring trade and money into the Empire.

The Unvariant Empire is ruled and goverened by a parliament of ancient elves. However, their council room has remained empty for centuries, perhaps millenia, as prior meetings showed that the Empire has no interest in change, so any discussion about the matter would be moot.

Instead, small scale changes and day to day decisions are made by the council in the areas of the Empire that they govern.


#### The Galls
Named by their peers for their bravery and daring attitude for trying new things, the Galls love to make and create new inventions, even if most of them have already been made by the other nations. The Galls love to have their own take and mark on their tools and possessions, and will endeavour to have a Gall made item over those of other cultures.

Something that has captured the Galls attention in recent years is exploring across the seas to a continent apparently rich with resources, and low on inhabitants. After sending a few expeditionary sailors, a few Gall engineers pushed for a fully funded development program in the Oest, as they'd named the continent. Led by young upstart Ekindra Feyheart, the engineers set up the Oestern Trading Company, or the OTC, and established the port city of Safe Haven, a town rife with crime and opportunity.

After a few issues with the sparse native races of the Oest, the OTC has begun to act more and more independently, seeing less reason to report back to the Galls back home. Whilst the Galls hold a certain respect for this attempt at independence, the riches they received from the OTC were too valuable to simply let go...


#### The Croaking Conclave
The Croaking Conclave is an area high in the eastern mountain regions of Focura, and is inhabited by Rana. They have a respect for nature above themselves, and strive to maintain harmony and peace in the Conclave.

Because the grounds they live on are sacred, the Conclave try not to advertise their location, although they welcome friendly strangers and hope to impart on them any wisdom they think would be helpful.

#### The High Mount Dwarves
As their name suggests, the High Mount Dwarves live in High Mount, a mountainous region in the centre of Focura. Often rumoured to be an ancient citadel of the gods themselves, it is home to great palaces hewn from stone, and plenty of feasting dwarves.


\pagebreakNum

## The Oest
The Oest is the name given by the Galls to the central part of the western continent. With a sparse population, and an unforgiving terrain, the Oest is a frontier wrought with dangers and ancient mysteries.

### Factions in The Oest
#### The OTC
A settlement of Galls, the Oestern Trading Company maintains control over Safe Haven, as well as other smaller settlements dotted across the Oest. Most of their wealth comes from trading with the people of Lodestowne, and mining lodestones from the mountain ranges. Several excursions are arranged with Ra-Khel guides into their ancient temples, in search of treasures and knowledge.

##### Safe Haven
Safe Haven is the main city settlement of the OTC. Located on the east coast of the Oest, it holds a vast port and a looming spired tower, in which sits Ekindra Feyheart, master of the OTC.

#### The Ra-Khel

##### Aven Warriors
A mysterious race of bird-like humanoids, the Ra-Khel live in the mountainous region of the Oest. Practicing cultural rituals honouring the sun goddess Ra, the Ra-Khel live mostly secluded lives, seldom leaving to communicate with the other tribes in the Oest, deeming them inferior heathens.
The Ra-Khel are a proud race, and despite never mingling with other cultures, maintain a strong military sect, as a display to the goddess that they are worthy of their continued blessings. From time to time, as The Calendar dictates, the Ra-Khel migrate their settlement across the mountains leaving behind old ruins and ancient temples, building new ones wherever they settle. For many adventurers, the legends of old temples full of riches and wondrous ancient artefacts serve as a lure to the Oest and its mountains.

##### The Calendar
One of the most important aspects of Ra-Khel rituals is respecting The Calendar. An ancient prophecy written by long forgotten seers, The Calendar predates much of the Oest, and has been eerily correct in its predictions, although those living through the events foretold are often skeptical of its precision, and attribute much of its performance down to luck and vagueness. A Ra-Khel’s day of birth holds significant value, and decides the path a new child will walk later in life. For most, this merely pushes or hints towards a future as a farmer or labourer, but for those unfortunate few born on the full moon - or an empty moon - it means a life of exile or sacrifice.

\columnbreak


##### The Lunar Cycle
From The Calendar, the lunar cycle impacts the Ra-Khel culture significantly, with the waxing and waning of the moon being signs of change and growth, allowing for progression for those born under it. However, the full moon and empty moon are regarded as signs of stagnation, or immediate turning of fortune, and those born under them are regarded as the unlucky, and bad omens. These few are allowed to live amongst the Ra-Khel for their maturing years - albeit experiencing lesser lives than their peers, and once they have gained maturity, they are given the choice of exile, or self sacrifice in the hopes of appeasing the great Ra.

##### Khel-Ak Ra
The capitol city of the Ra-Khel, Khel-Ak Ra is home to the Destiny Weavers, seers who try to ensure that no one is attempting the destroy the


#### Lodestowne
Led by King, a millenia-old king, the people of Lodestowne used to be nomadic, but when the OTC arrived they decided it would be best to put down some hard borders, to maintain strength and confidence against the new faction. Their main settlement, Lodestowne, has most of the culture inside, but there remain a few that set up travel routes around the Oest

#### The Sooth
An ancient civilisation from the south, the Sooth had a fascination with time magic. Their end goal, which ended up causing a civil war against the Morak faction, was to perfect the loop of reincarnation, such that they could live forever with no new souls, just endless life.

What ensued was a war with the Moraks, who were against the idea, despite being the first to create the technology and magic required. Whatever they saw in their creation upset them, and after a long war they eventually lost, banishing themselves away from the Sooth as a last resort, in the hopes of recovering themselves in peace.
#### The Moraks
After their war with the Sooth, the Moraks were bound to metallic skeletal bodies, in a cruel twist of fate becoming immortal and timeless.

Hidden away at the bottom of the ocean, just east of the Oest, the Moraks slumbered for many years, until devastation in Safe Haven sunk a ship of adventurers, who managed to help restore the Morak city, Morakura, to above the ocean. Led by King Crow Nos, they now work alongside the OTC in case the Sooth start any strange plans.

# The Great Realms
At the top of the western continent lies the Great Realms, inhabited and ruled by Dragons, Dragonborn, and Kobolds.

The nation is split into many Realms, each one presided over by a different Dragon Lord or Lady, and each has its own cultural focus with which to enrich the Great Realms.

### The Platinum Realm
#### Caves of Origin
The cave in which the platinum dragon was born. Carved from her initial fury, and sculpted by her succeeding calm, these caves extend for miles. Former warrens of ancient kobold cultures run amok through the rocks, with pools of water and errant passages of light breaking the patterns up.

#### Palace Ruins
A once grand palace, welcome to all, now fallen and in ruins. Supported by vines and roots of the overgrown gardens, the towers and chambers threaten to collapse should they be disturbed.
Recently a great beacon of light has begun to emit from the centre of the domed roofing, above what used to be the Great Hall.

### The Bronze Realms - Highwatch Coast and Cliffs of Vigilance
Jagged rocks and stony cliffs guard this realm, deterring any to approach from anywhere but the established ports and harbours. The wrecks of smugglers and curious fools serve as a quick reminder for any thinking of sneaking ashore.

On the shore, the realm is scattered with small war camps and outposts. Each warcamp is proudly self-sufficient, but still embraces exchange of goods from other camps, only relying solely on their own produce in times of war.

Small areas of hilltops are guarded and watched closely, for inside lurks those that would threaten the Great Realms. Strange creatures have always crept inside the hill tunnels, ranging from the feral beasts of great stature, to the more horrifying creatures of night, and their unholy thralls.

In the centre of the Cliffs of Vigilance, there lies a copse of trees, untouched since the early days. Within lies an ancient shrine to the Dragon Mother. What used to be a calm, holy shrine, and a place of pilgrimage for the bronze kobolds, now lies in a poisoned marsh, with a sick radiant energy emanating from it.

### The Silver Realm - Great Mines
Up in the Silver Mountains, the Great Mines work their way through ore vein after ore vein. The kobolds of the region exploit these to the benefit of all the Great Realms. Though metals are present across many of the Realms, they are most concentrated and with great diversity in the Great Mines.

The mines are spread out into small processing centres, which lack any identity or culture of their own, with the main focus of the Silver Kobold culture being focused in the large city of Argentum. Kobolds are frequently rotated between processing centres, to encourage knowledge about all the metals in the Realms.

### The Mercury Realm - Fields of Change
The Fields of Change are mostly empty. Far stretching fields of grassland, interrupted only by an occasional tree, separate the lonely farmsteads and inns that make up the populated areas of the Fields. This Realm attracts those that are lost, and offers a chance for them to leave their home Realm in order to seek a more comfortable life.

Farmsteads are run by the oldest dragonborn families, and warmly welcome any lost kobolds into their employ. The steads rarely have more than a few houses on them, encouraging new steads to be built instead of expanding existing ones.
Inns are run by any kobold brave enough to build one. Many travellers pass through the Fields of Change on their way to other places - such as the Golden City - and as such these routes attract the bandits and miscreants who prey on the defenseless.

### The Golden Realm - City of Gold
The Golden Realm is restricted to the City of Gold. Forsaking quantity of land, the Golden dragon chose instead the quality of the land. The City of Gold houses all sorts of merchant guilds and artisans, who take the resources sold by those from the outer realms, and turn them into crafted commodities.

The Guild Masters also oversee and supervise the trade of the kobolds in the city, and in exchange for a fair market, take a cut of any trade.

### The Copper Realm - Crafted Mountains
Up in the copper Realms lie the mysterious villages of the Crafted Mountains. Each village specialises in their own unique craft, be it music or woodwork or carving, and guards its secrets mostly closely. Whilst kobolds are encouraged to travel when they are young, they are also expected to commit to a craft for their adult profession.

\pagebreakNum

In the centre of the Realm lies a great amphitheatre, which lies unused for most of the year, before the yearly celebrations begin. During these celebrations the kobolds bring their works for the year and share or perform them.


## The Creation of the Realms
### Descent of the Dragon
In the beginning, the Great Realms was a barren landscape, containing only rocks and lacking in any sort of life. Though other parts of the world had by this time started to form sentient life, the Great Realms stayed bare of any of its own.

In time there came a meteor shower, and from it fell a single meteorite. So fast and heavy did it fall, that it penetrated the surface of the ground and buried itself deep. Many more years passed, and in an odd way, a cave began to form around the meteorite.

Finally, the meteorite began to hatch, for it was in fact an egg, and out came Her, the firstborn. Quickly she grew hungry, and could not get by on the mere worms that were her only company, and so she began her song. Weaving the aether from around her, pulling strange magics from instinctual memories, she crafted a new land for herself.

Initially this was just the caves, a vibrant underdark of plants and small creatures for her to feed on, and plenty of space to fly and survey her home. But in time she grew curious, and so broke the surface at last. Roaming over what would become the Great Realms, she was disappointed to find yet more rocks and stones. Once again she drew the aether, and began to shape the land.

Over years she crafted the rivers, the mountains, the fields, and all else beneath her. She filled the land with beasts, and creatures of many kinds, drawing from the aether the knowledge of what animals might survive well in her lands, and in time the Great Realms were full of vibrant life, and she was pleased with her work.

But now she grew lonely, and so she created a species in her own image: The kobolds, who were there to serve her, entertain her, and help her care for the land she had made for herself. She wanted them to grow and learn alongside the land, and thus did not grant them flight, nor much of the magics she herself possessed. She helped guide them across the land, and for a while waited, watched, and aided the growth of her new people.

Brave, cunning, and curious, the kobolds’ power lay in their coordination and cooperation, a people who cared for the land, and who were not greedy. She was pleased with how they had developed, and sought to create more creatures across the land.

But as she started to pull the aether once more, she found something different; the energy had changed, and was more volatile. The world was not at peace, and it was not time for a new people. Concerned for the kobolds’ safety, She decided to set out and find the cause of this danger. But first She wove a careful spell, using as much of the aether as she dared, and created 9 Lords of her land.

These Lords, who were made so powerful and strong after herself, she blessed with flight and certain magics each. She split the land into the Great Realms, and assigned them each a Realm. She helped them establish themselves as leaders for the kobolds of those areas, and also allowed them to give out blessings; occasionally a kobold would be born in a more powerful form, and they would serve as protectors and leaders whilst the Lords were busy elsewhere.

Satisfied with her precautions, she set out in search of what was wrong with the world.

### The Great Realms
For a while she did not return. And despite her absence the Great Realms thrived, and the 9 Lords, whilst occasionally disputing how far their Realms extended, maintained peace, and focused instead on the development of their own cultures.

The two Bronze Lords, who lay on the coasts, were of similar minds, and set up defensive settlements, and encouraged their people to train for war, in case of outsiders approaching their coasts.

The Silver Lord, in the north west mountains, found his realm to be rich in materials, some that were found elsewhere in the Realms, but not as plentiful. As such, he dedicated his craft to refining these materials, and using them to make tools for all purposes.

In the opposite mountains, the Copper Lord found peace and calm, and encouraged his culture to develop around finding joy in anything they fancied, and so a people of artisans and artists was born.

Underground, the Steel Lord worked in forges and volcanic furnaces, and he and his kobolds focused on the weapons and magical artefacts of the world.

The Brass Lord took up residence in the southern desert, and through its inhospitality made sure none would cross the border of the Realms. Her people became hardy and able to live on nearly nothing, relying on the oases provided by their Lord.

In the centre of the Realms lay great fields, and it was here that the Mercury Lord took up stead. She encouraged her kobolds to spread out, be independent, and encouraged them to seek their own destinies.

And the middle most Realm was that of the Gold Lord. A city they built, and in it they created markets and trade centres such that all the Realms could exchange their practices and wares without worry of unfair exchange.

In Her absence, the Lords made sure that Her abode, a great palace above her birth caves, was well maintained, and each sent a regiment of kobolds to help the caretaking effort.

\pagebreakNum

### Exodus
After a great time, the Realms had become rich, and the Lords were content, as were their people. But still She had not returned, and the Lords began to worry.

In the end it was decided, two of the Lords would depart for the far corners of the world, and try to find what had happened to Her. The first of the two would be the Steel Lord, for he and his people were keen and clever with their weaponry, and would be able to overcome any dangers they encountered. The second would be the Brass Lord, for the desert would be a buffer on its own, and the Brass people were able to endure many hardships.

After the furnaces were put to rest, and the oases dried out, they made off in a great fleet, and swore to find Her.

They did not return.

## The Platinum Lady's Journey
### The Oest and the Ra-Khel
The Platinum Lady began by travelling south, following the trails of chaos in the aether. She found there a new people and burgeoning culture. Prying into their minds with her magic, she discovered that they were similar to her kobolds; they had been created by one of similar power to her own. After investigation, she determined that this other power must have been affected by the chaos in the aether, and had suffered greatly from it. Shards of power had embedded themselves in the land, each one containing a piece of aether from whatever great magic had gone wrong.

The Lady took pity upon the people, and assumed a form they associated with their deity. They called themselves the Ra Khel, and their deity Ra. Sensing that the Ra Khel would not survive without a source of power to worship and siphon from, the Lady imbued some of her power into their city, and promised to look after their land. She took the name Ra, and swore to ensure the sun would shine eternal over their lands. But then she once more had to leave, and set off eastwards.


### Between Worlds
Across her travels the Lady encountered many other civilisations and people. Some she met who were short and stocky, others tall and slender. She met other deities, those with powers to rival her own, and they told her of a great struggle in an isolated land. They mentioned that those from the Hellscape had found a way through into the world, and were trying to force their way in. She took directions, and went towards the conflict.
> ##### Ancient Wanderings
> So long ago was the Platinum Lady's journey, she inspired many myths in the then developing cultures across Londirix

### The Gate of Hell
In the middle of a lone island, the Lady found a great pit, a vast canyon leading into the ground. Surrounding it was a great force made up of people from across the world, united to prevent the darkest demons from escaping the Hellscape. She aided the effort for many years, and eventually they triumphed against the threat, managing to reduce the pit to a manageable size. The Lady was ready to depart once more, now that the aether had healed, but she was tricked by her allies, and bound to the pit as its guardian. She fought against the spell, but it was too late, and she was left alone to guard the pit.

Many, many years passed, until eventually a familiar force arrived. Headed by the Steel and Brass Lords, a great fleet of her people arrived, and they started to work on freeing her from the enchantment. As they did so, they began to build a great city above the pit, so that they could supervise the pit in a more cultured fashion.

Eventually the Lady was freed, and she asked that the two Lords and their people would stay and guard the pit in her stead. She asked that the secrets of the pit must never leave the island, and all those who entered the city should not be allowed to leave without special permission. She knew that the power residing in the pit would continue to attract those from all over, as it did when she was its guardian. Now, at least, they could pretend as though the city was the source of power.

And so she left the new city, and began to return home, albeit on a roundabout route that she might take some vengeance on those that wronged her...

# The Bilencaus
## Poisoned Land
Long ago, the ancient civilisation of the Sooth grew too ambitious, and collapsed in a civil war against the Morak faction. The resultant fallout left the southern part of the western continent almost uninhabitable, as the radiant magic in the land contaminated the air and made it unbreathable for most mortals.

A few animals and creatures could resist or absorb the magic, and thrive in the now boglands of the Bilencaus. They are inherently dangerous due to their magical adaptations, and those few that trek between settlements take great care to stick to the paths.

## Settlements
Few settlements are dotted about the Bilencaus, most of which are built on or near old Sooth ruins.
### Murkwater
The largest city in the Bilencaus, it still isn't that large. Consisting of no more than a dozen blocks of housing and a few more for trade and industry, it sits on stilts of wood atop the bog and swampland.

### Heem Ho
A goblin settlement in a mountainous area of the Bilencaus, Heem Ho is one of the few places left with access to uncontaminated air. Shielded from the fallout inside caverns and tunnels, the air received no affect from the war.

As Heem Ho is quite centrally located, it is the most common stopping point for travelers who need to restock on breathable air. This has made the goblins of the town quite rich, which they use to fortify Heem Ho and cement their place in the land.

# The Storm Islands
## A Broken Archipelago
Originally an inland lake, the Storm Islands came to be when Kraken, progenitor of all krakens, was struck down by the gods, and its flailing tentacles split the land into the islands. What became of Kraken, no one is certain, but its offspring still terrorise the inhabitants and sailors.

## Pirates
The Storm Islands is home to no real nations or factions. So temperamental are the storms and seas, that any fool trying to control them is doomed for failure. Instead, sailors and pirates band together offering services, cheaper "services", and protection from these "services".

\pagebreakNum

# The Restless Fields
## A Changing Landscape
The Restless Fields are ever changing. Magically transforming from plains, to mountains, to savannah, to jungle, the Fields are inhabited by nomadic cultures that follow their preferred resources as it migrates along the continent.

\pagebreakNum

# The Shattered Divide
## Mirrored Fates
The inhabitants of the Divided Islands used to be united on one continent, a prosperous people. Until one day, a wrathful Trade Baron decided he was owed all of another's wealth, and another's after that, and after that. He was fueled not by avarice, but instead by a vengeance to rip apart those that dared to interfere with his trade routes.

Eventually his terror grew to heights unbearable for the people of the continent, and so they and their strongest magi induced a cataclysm strong enough to split the islands in twain.

Now the island's people have diverged in lineage slightly: the western island is populated by the Leonin, the free people who escaped the Baron's rampages, and the eastern island by the Rakshasa, descended from those who remained in the wake of the war. Leonin stand smaller, slimmer, and are more communal, whereas the Rakshasa stand proud, firm, and with little desire to share.

What happened to the Baron is not known, but it is said he gradually disappeared from the realm, never to be seen again. Although those that reside in his old manor tell tales of his presence still lingering, as though he was watching from another plane.

\pagebreakNum

# Gnome Island
## Floating High Above
In the skies of Londirix, high above the clouds, Gnome Island floats. Inhabited by gnomes, tinkerers and curious folk, the island makes its slow way over different parts of the world, with seemingly no direction.

The gnomes of Gnome Island are forever curious to find out more about what's below, on the non-moving parts of Londirix. So they have turned Gnome Island into a research station, with turbines and sensors and thaumatic equipment. But the only way they can reach the ground is via portals, which they can calibrate to any solid ground they float over.

They equip a gnome with enough gear to help them survive, then bid them good luck. Away goes the gnome through the portal, with the full intent to report back after learning the truths. But none ever do.

## The Gnomes' Curse
There is a curse put upon the gnomes, by whom no one is sure, and the gnomes themselves do not realise. For whenever a gnome makes their way out the portal, they are overcome with a need to destroy their Sending Stone, and assimilate best they can to the culture around them.

Quickly they lose their memory of where they came from, although they know that they came from *somewhere*. Each gnome forever spends their life in pursuit of knowledge once again, only this time about themselves instead of others.

\pagebreakNum

# Hellspire

## City Overview
Hellspire is a great, looming city with two rings of walls, and a great spired stronghold at the back. The people of Hellspire are diverse in race and personalities, though the guard is made up of the Steel Lord's dragonborn. There are many factions at large in Hellspire, including The Inquisition, who have been quite prolific of late. Whilst demons and devils and other hell spawn have always been barred from entering the city walls, The Inquisition has started to aggressively root out and purge those they suspect or accuse of harbouring hellspawn.
#### The Outer Walls
Eighteen feet tall and made of pearly stone, the outer walls tower over those who try to enter.

On the tops of the walls stand guard the Steelborne Dragonborn, keeping a watchful eye over the vast desert surrounding the city. Water flows across the top of the walls like a river, in an attempt to confuse attackers or mischief makers. Hidden below the surface are stepping stones that the guards can use to gain an advantage against these miscreants.
#### Front Gate
The front gate is guarded by Grey Watchmen, who take shifts. Upon entering the gate, there is a small area where stalls are setup on market days.

Immediately off of this area lies The Hovels, with a single paved street leading away to the Great Plaza.
#### Market Stalls
A diverse array of stalls present potential customers with the option of many common and widespread goods, such as basic foods, simple tools, and the occasional exotic goods like potions or scrolls.
#### The Great Plaza
A vast tiled plaza that is intended as a general purpose area for denizens of Hellspire. Mostly used by common folk during the day, with richer and more elitist socialites having private areas to meet. Main features are styled mosaics and impressive fountains.

On special occasions the plaza is used for festivals and announcements, or processions for noteworthy characters in the city.

The plaza has several major exits, leading to the Upper Ring, the Steel Hold, and the Industrial Quart.
#### The Hovels
The Hovels is the poorest area of Hellspire. Poor is relative, since most of the denizens in the city are skilled adventurers who can work their profession for profit quite comfortably. However, the houses, whilst not squalor by any means, are still packed close and tight, and share guttering and other systems.
______
______
#### Chapels Hill
In The Hovels rests a hill with multiple chapels on it. Each chapel is dedicated to various gods or cultural icons, with no real order. These chapels were built and expanded upon as more and more adventurers made their way into Hellspire.
#### Beckons’ Graveyard
Behind Chapels Hill lies Beckons’ Graveyard, named after its first resident, Justice Beckons. There are many unmarked graves, but most of the graves have a headstone of varying quality.


At night, ghosts of unsatisfied souls linger amongst the graves. They are generally non-aggressive, instead just passively bitter about their lack of fulfilment in life.
#### The Upper Ring
An area populated by rich socialites who somehow made their way to Hellspire and refused to give up their comforts, the upper ring is home to beautiful gardens, meeting houses and water features.
#### The Promenade
A long walk through botanical gardens, which seem to house every plant imaginable, the promenade leads to the Great Temple, before veering down to a secret garden intended for mindful introspection and peace.
#### The Great Temple
An unmarked temple of old, the Great Temple boasts incredible artwork and architectural design. Those who enter are speechless if asked to describe its wonders, insisting only that one must witness its glory for themselves to truly understand.
#### The Industrial Quart
Steaming fumes and choking smog fills the sky in oddly regular geometric clouds above the factories and warehouses.

The Canal winds its way through the backends, connecting to each building before leading away into the tower.
#### The Canal
A waterway designed for the transport of raw materials and goods to move between the factories and the rest of the city. It goes inside the Hellspire Tower itself for processing, before being taken for offloading in the Hovels and Upper Ring.

#### The Trademasters Guildhall
The Trademasters Guildhall is a meeting place and trade hall for business owners to discuss and negotiate deals. Any disputes are handled by a committee in the Guildhall and monthly dues are expected by those under the Guildhall’s charter, which is required to enter the building.

# The Gods of Londirix
## Few and Far between
The Gods of Londirix are mostly absent from the lands. They exert most of their influence via a few chosen devout, but are otherwise uninvolved.

The reason for their apathy is unknown, though mostly theologists speculate that a lack of respect and regard for the Gods' powers. This is supported by the fact that the western continent seems almost entirely abandoned by the Gods.

In an attempt to fix this, the people of Londirix, especially in Focura, have begun to enact rituals and performances in an attempt to pray for forgiveness from the Gods.

The Gods are divided into a few groups.

First the Eldest gods of the Natural Pantheon, those that represent intrinsic aspects of the natural world. They are often the most powerful, but the least likely to intervene in mortal affairs.

Next are those in the Civil Pantheon, gods that came with burgeoning societies, that represent aspects of civilisation and culture. They hold great power, and are likely to intervene with events that pertain to their domain.

Last are the rogue gods, a group made out of lesser beings that became gods. They often tread on the domains of other gods, but avoid ire by operating in areas that the other gods avoid. Most being ascended mortals, they are much more likely to run schemes and intervene in the world, as it was likely their purpose of attaining godhood in the first place.

There are many ways in Londirix to become a god, although they are well kept secrets, and require powerful individuals to enact the rituals.

### The Natural Pantheon
Six Entities from far beyond, the Natural Pantheon created Londirix long ago, for reasons unknown. Some say they were to play a game, to place a wager on how the world would progress. Others say they were forced to create it, to trap the souls of the damned and give them one last chance at redemption. What most agree on, though, are the roles and names of each Entity.


#### God of Life - Spri'eek
Held in the highest regard by the denizens of Londirix, the God of Life Spri'eek oversees the bloom of life across the world.
They tend to each new life with the utmost care, but then immediately let it fend for itself once born. Life, the giving of it, is Their responsibility, and anything after does not concern Them.

#### God of Death - Ish'per
Next is Ish'Per, God of Death. Unlike Spri'eek, Ish'per waits, watching, curiously stalking those it will soon claim, and will regularly check up upon those who have passed through to another plane.

#### God of Day - Crol'rim
Crol'rim is perhaps the most trusted of the Natural Gods, His domain that of the Day, where most denizens spend their waking hours. He rarely interacts with mortals, but has been known to monitor those that worship and preach for His cause, making sure any discrepancies are *corrected*.

#### God of Night - Den'wyt
The God of Night, Den'wyt, is the most absent of Her Pantheon. The night comes with Her darkness, and She cares not to govern those that work beneath it. Any who try, try on their own fortune, alone.

#### God of Entropy - Tual'ven
All things come to a slow end, and Tual'ven is waiting there ready. Whilst Ish'per governs those whose physical form dies, Tual'ven watches for the moment that a concept, a memory, an ideal stops existing, the impetus removed from the world. It is said He collects these that fade away, but is loathe to share.

#### God of Planes - Zak'zar
Zak'zar is the most present of the Natural Gods, for Their power is required each time planar travel is achieved. They are revered by the Gnomes of Gnome Island, and those wise enough to ask Their blessing when travelling through. Zak'zar care not, really, who travels, unless they intend on travelling to Their palace, but those are few who know or try such a feat.


### The Civil Pantheon

#### God of War - Agres
Since creatures have had thoughts of self, they have had thoughts of war. Agres watches over, regulates, and often incites violence between factions on Londirix.

#### God of Roads - Pave
Pave is the god of travel, roads, and in-betweens. Any passage is his domain, as are straits, fords, bridges, and tunnels. He makes sure no monsters lurk too near to the major routes, and aids those accosted upon them.

#### God of Seas - Bow'Tee
Upon the waves, sailors find little respite, as Bow'Tee cares more for the monsters than they do the more civilised creatures. Large beasts roam the oceans, feeding on those unfortunate enough to fall in. Luckily for sailors, Pave ensures that Bow'Tee does not go too far in sinking ships,

#### God of Bargains

#### God of Justice

#### God of Home

\pagebreakNum

### The Rogue Gods

#### The Platinum Lady
Progenitor of the metallic dragons and dragonborn, the Platinum Lady came from the cosmos, landing aeons ago in a comet. Now she wields power matching that of higher gods, she seeks mainly to maintain whatever order she finds upon the lands.

#### Ra
Goddess of the Sun in the Oest, and one of the few deities that stuck around on the continent, Ra lay dormant in a reduced state of power after being saved somewhat by the Platinum Lady

#### Vortus
A god born of mischief, with an affinity for change, Vortus eventually found a place for himself being responsible for the Moon in the Oest, and watching over those that seek to change their fate beneath it. Whilst he will inevitably trick those he guides, many of his tricks serve to push mortals into the paths they wish to tread, and they thank him for it.

#### Gustave
Gustave was given minor godhood by Mogswump Mosey, who was trying to restore a sense of faith to the Oest, but he betrayed her and, as all gods of murder should, went to kill Ra. He succeeded in greatly weakening her, and creating a fearful night over the Oest. After a month of tyranny, his reign was ended and Ra restored to her former power.

#### Peche

#### Hareep

#### Goddess of Love

# The Hellscape
## A Sinful Land
The Hellscape is the infernal plane, where fiends originate and reside. For most of their time, fiends - at least the ones that can think for themselves - live in settlements spread out across the vast landscape.

Lava flows and volcanic geysers litter the Hellscape, and the less group inclined fiends roam freely between settlements.

In the Hellscape rule seven Daearchs, each one personifying a sin of the sapient. Each Daearch imbues those that congregate around it with their own boon of power, that cannot be removed except by that Daearch.

To become a Daearch, one must closely align with the sin it represents, and kill the current Daearch.


### Pride
#### Daearch - The Dread Toad, Lick
The Dread Toad hails from the Bilencaus bogs, where he was able to slowly amass his power, luring in strangers with his croaks. Now he has become all powerful, standing proudly above his empire of obsidian.

### Wrath
#### Daearch - Zarola Trespire
Zarola rules with an iron fist, and several magical blades. A newcomer to hell, she’s quickly cemented her place as one of the most wrathful mortals to claim a Daearchy

### Gluttony
#### Daearch - Death Cloud
The death cloud of smog rolls across the hellscape, feeding on anything foolish enough to be in its path.
Inside lurks a secret, a dark forge spewing the smog as a cloak. The forge seems to be its own master, with a mind of its own.

### Avarice
#### Daearch - Clunk
Clunk was a gnome who fell a little too far. Landing in Hell, she rapidly assimilated by losing parts of her mortal form, replacing them with obsidian prosthetics. She now almost never sleeps, greedy for more and more time each day with which to tinker and upgrade herself even more.

### Lust
#### Daearch - Amordeus
Amordeus is a Hell born demon, powerful and filled with lust for life, and most things living it. His harem, a collection of every devilish fiend or mortal that is lured to his palace, spends far too much time *together* to be worried about conquest.

### Envy
#### Daearch - Thy Purity
Originally from the Heavenly planes, Thy Purity grew envious of those on other planes, especially the raw power found down in Hell. Possessing great strength himself, he managed to split his physical form between both planes, receiving both blessings and curses of both. He regrets nothing and considers his form one of the most divine.
### Sloth
#### Daearch - Bobby
Bobby comes from another time, a place beyond veils. Cursed with never ending talent and ease, he also knows exactly how most things go in these situations. His complete apathy to trying to change the world led him to just let things happen, and those in hell were waiting excitedly when he finally arrived. No one greeted him though, that’s going a bit far…




\pagebreakNum

# The Heavenly Plane
## Divine in Name and Nature
On the Heavenly Plane resides some of the Deities of Londirix, but it is mostly devout followers, or Angelic beings that encourage and reward behaviour they deem good.

The Heavenly Plane is not ruled, in the common sense, by any powers, but it is maintained by ideals embodied in groups of individuals known as Virtuosos. These Virtuosos represent the seven great Virtues, an opposing force to the Hellscape's Sins. Unlike the Daearchs, however, the Virtuosos' Blessings are not merely given to any that pledges fealty, but are instead reserved only for those that demonstrate meaningful and impressive acts of the Virtue they wish to represent.

None have ever replaced a Virtuoso in its role, although few across the centuries have joined their ranks. These few were all Angelic beings themselves, and it is unclear if mortals can - or will be allowed to - become Virtuosos.

### Humility
The most willing to imbue their Blessing, the five Virtuosos of Humility roam the Heavenly Plane on their own, meandering without major intent, other than to find those to impart their teachings or Blessing upon.

### Patience

### Temperance

### Charity

### Purity
The only virtue upheld by a single Virtuoso, Purity is the absence of lust, impulsive thinking, and gratification. Instead, those that practice Purity show great restraint when confronted by desire, and forgoing mortal needs for the sake of a greater cause.

### Generosity

### Diligence

\pagebreakNum

# Limbo
## The Worlds Between
Souls whose religion believes strongly in an idea of purgatory, an in-between world, or ways back from death, are likely to find themselves in Limbo, at least for a little while. A plane of existence where nothing is permanent, and appearing different to those from different backgrounds, Limbo holds those who have unfinished business in the physical plane, or are unsure where they should be placed in an afterlife, if any.

## The Preacher
In the Oest, death has often been regarded as a fated thing, and so if a soul dies before it expects to - an oddly common experience for many - it ends up in the Preacher's Chapel.

The Preacher themselves takes the form of a deathly Ra-Khel, greying and dusty. They offer the souls choices of moving on, a chance to return, or just to wait a while and watch the world. Very rarely does the Preacher opt to intervene in world events.

### Unpredictable Power
Imbued are those who have great power within them, but struggle to fully realise it on demand. Instead, it seeps out at their most vulnerable moments, sending them into a frenzied Dwam state, where their instincts take over and unleash their full potential.

### Making an Imbued

##### Hit Points
<b> Hit Dice: </b>1d4
<br>
<b> Hit Points at 1st Level: </b> 4 + your Constitution modifier.
<br>
<b> Hit Points at Higher Levels </b> 1d4 (or 3) + your Constitution modifier per Imbued level after 1st.
<br>

##### Proficiencies
<b> Armour: </b> None
<br>
<b> Weapons: </b> Simple
<br>
<b> Saving Throws: </b> Dexterity, Wisdom
<br>
<b> Skills: </b> Choose 2 from: Arcana, Insight, Investigation, Religion, Stealth, Survival

##### Starting Equipment
You start with 2d4x10 GP to buy starting equipment.

### Power Dice
At 1st level, your power erupts in small bursts, strengthening your attacks. You gain 2 Power Dice. The size and amount of your Power Dice depends on your Imbued Level.

| Level  | Power Dice |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | d4 |
|  5  | d6 |
|  10  | d8 |
|  15  | d10 |

When you make an attack or damage roll, you may roll a Power Die to increase the total by that amount.

You regain all your Power Dice when you take a long rest.

\pagebreakNum

### Dwam
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to enter Dwam, a semi-concious state where you let your instincts take over and channel your power at its strongest. As a reaction whenever you would take damage, you may roll a Power Die to reduce the damage taken by the result of the roll, then enter Dwam.

Your Dwam lasts a number of turns equal to the result of the rolled Power Die, to a minimum equal to your Proficiency Bonus, during which you gain the following effects:
* You may cast any *abjuration*, *evocation*, or *illusion* spell of level equal to or less than your Dwam Spell Level (shown in the Imbued Table).
* If you would restore Hit Points to yourself or other creatures, they instead gain Inspiration.
* Your movement speed becomes 10ft, and you gain a fly speed of 20ft.
* You do not require VSM components for spells.
* Your Spell Attacks ignore cover, and you don't need vision of creatures to target them.

Your Dwam also ends if you become unconscious.

You can enter Dwam a number of times as shown on the Imbued Table. You regain all your uses on a long rest.

When you cast a spell in Dwam, your Spell Attack Modifier is equal your Proficiency Bonus + Dwam Spell Level.

Similarly, your Spell Save DC is equal to 10 + your Proficiency Bonus + Dwam Spell Level.

### Apologetic Aid
You've quickly become aware that many view you as a bit weak when not in Dwam. To counter this, you've honed ways to aid your allies in battle. At 2nd Level, whenever you take the Aid action in combat, you may choose one of the following:
* The creature you Aid gains 5 Temporary Hit Points.
* The creature you Aid gains Inspiriation.


### Imbuement Source
At 3rd level, the source of your power becomes apparent. Choose one of the Sources described at the end of the Imbued class description.


### Reliable Power
At 7th Level, you gain a greater control over your power bursts. Whenever you roll a Power Die, you may re-roll it. You must take the second result.


## Imbuement Sources

### Divine Blessing
Your power stems from a blessing granted by a Deity.

#### Holy Direction
Your Deity guides your movements and aids you in combat, deflecting would-be strikes on your self. At 3rd level, when you enter Dwam, your AC increases by your Wisdom Modifier. This bonus reduces by 1 on each of your subsequent turns, to a minimum of 0. You lose any remaining bonus when you exit Dwam.

#### Divine Spirit
Your Deity deigns to aid your allies in order to keep you alive.

At 6th level, as part of your Apologetic Aid, you may also cast *Cure Wounds* at 3rd Level. Once you do, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

Additionally, whilst you aren't in Dwam, friendly creatures have advantage to hit creatures within 5ft of you.

### Demonic Host
Something inside of you has been corrupted by a demonic entity. Your power stems from it lashing out.

#### Demonic Fervour
The corruption inside has an unbearable rage, occasionally escaping. At 3rd level, on your turn whilst in Dwam, you may make a spell attack as a bonus action at a creature within 15ft. This attack is made as though you were in Dwam, using your Strength Modifier instead of Dwam Spell Level where applicable.

On a hit, this attack deals 1d4 + Strength Modifier force damage.

#### Half-Fiend
The power inside you strengthens, and affects your physical form when tapped.

At 6th level, whenever you enter Dwam, you gain the following additional benefits:
* Your AC becomes equal to 10 + Strength Modifier + Dexterity Modifier
* You gain Proficiency in all Weapons.



### Self Endowed
Your power stems from your own sheer force of will.

### Masters of the Elements
Similar to Druids, Shamans study the world around them, and are well practiced in the natural arts. Where their druidic cousins focus on the flora and fauna, Shamans instead focus on the base Elements that make up the world, and the cycles that bind the living to the physical plane.

### Making a Shaman

##### Hit Points
<b> Hit Dice: </b>1d8
<br>
<b> Hit Points at 1st Level: </b> 8 + your Constitution modifier.
<br>
<b> Hit Points at Higher Levels </b> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per Shaman level after 1st.
<br>

##### Proficiencies
<b> Armour: </b> Light armour, Shields
<br>
<b> Weapons: </b> Simple
<br>
<b> Saving Throws: </b> Strength, Constitution
<br>
<b> Skills: </b> Choose 2 from: Arcana, History, Nature, Medicine, Religion, Survival

##### Starting Equipment
You start with 3d4x10 GP to buy starting equipment.

### Spellcasting
From your attunement with the world, you can draw on its magic and use it to aid and abet others.

##### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know 2 cantrips of your choice from the Shaman spell list.

\pagebreakNum

##### Spell Slots
The Shaman table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your shaman spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these shaman spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.


##### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know one 1st-level spell of your choice from the shaman spell list.

You learn an additional shaman spell of your choice at each level Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the shaman spells you know and replace it with another spell from the shaman spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

##### Spellcasting Ability

Strength is your spellcasting ability for your shaman spells. The power of your spells comes from your ability to channel the strength of the world. You use your Strength whenever a shaman spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Strength modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a shaman spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier

##### Ritual Casting

You can cast a shaman spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

##### Spellcasting Focus
You may use a quarterstaff, rod, orb or holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. In addition, your connection to the world allows you to weave magic with your whole body, allowing you to perform Somantic components of spells for free, provided your body is able to move freely.

### Elemental Attunement
You are naturally inclined to the world's base elements. Pick one as your Elemental Attunement. You will gain additional benefits at later levels.
##### Earth
You are tough like the earth. Your Hit Point Maximum increases by 4, and by an additional 2 per level in this class.

In addition, you know the *Mold Earth* cantrip. This does not count towards your total cantrips known.
##### Water
You are swift like water. Your speed increases by 10 feet, and you gain a swimming speed equal to your speed.

In addition, you know the *Shape Water* cantrip. This does not count towards your total cantrips known.
##### Air
You are ever-changing like the winds. When you roll lightning or thunder damage, you may re-roll 1 die. You must keep the result.

In addition, you know the *Lightning Lure* cantrip. This does not count towards your total cantrips known.
##### Fire
You are fierce like a roaring flame. Whenever you deal fire damage, you may deal additional damage equal to your Strength modifier.

In addition, you know the *Fire Bolt* cantrip. This does not count towards you total cantrips known.

### Totem Mastery
At 2nd level, your mastery grows such that you can create Totems, manifestations of your strength and connection with nature. They appear as ghostly visages of nature, commonly in the shape of foliage or fauna important to the shaman or the area.

As an action you can create a Totem by expending a spell slot. When you do, it appears as a small sized object in a 5 foot space adjacent to you. When you create the Totem choose on of the following benefits. Whilst within 5 feet of the Totem, you and friendly creatures gain that benefit.
<b>
* Affected creatures have advantage on Skill Checks, and Saving Throws vs non-magical effects
* Affected creatures may add your Strength Modifier to their damage rolls
* Whenever affected creatures have their Hit Points restored, they may add your Constitution Modifier to the amount restored.
</b>

The Totem occupies its space as though it were a friendly creature. It cannot be attacked, and enemies may move through it as though it were difficult terrain. Enemy creatures may not end their movement in the same space as the Totem.

If you create a new Totem, any existing totems are destroyed.

You may use your Totem as a spellcasting focus, provided you are within 30ft of it.

### Natural Affinity
At 3rd level, you learn to align yourself closely with an aspect of the physical plane. Choose one of the Affinities described at the end of the class description.

### Totemic Reach
At 5th level, the range at which your totem provides its benefits increases to 10ft.

\pagebreakNum

### Elemental Resistance
At 6th level, your attunement allows you to weather damage from the elements. You are resistant to the listed damage types:


| Element  | Resistance Gained |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Earth  | Bludgeoning, Slashing (non-magical), Piercing (non-magical) |
|  Water  | Cold, Poison |
|  Air  | Lightning, Thunder |
|  Fire  | Fire, Acid |

### Elemental Prowess
At 9th level your attunement gives you additional combat prowess:

| Element  | Prowess Ability |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Earth  | Enemy creatures within range of your Totem's reach cannot take the Dodge or Disengage actions.  |
|  Water  | You may swap places with your totem as you move. This does not provoke attacks of opportunity. |
|  Air  |  You have advantage on Initiative rolls. In addition, you automatically pass Dexterity Saving Throws whilst within the range of your Totem. |
|  Fire  | Whenever you deal Fire damage to a creature, it becomes marked for 1 minute. Any time you deal damage to a creature, deal half that damage as Fire damage to any marked creatures.|

### Totemic Body
At 10th level, when you create a Totem, you are always affected by the benefits, and other friendly creatures benefit if they are within 10ft of either you or the Totem.

### Natural Affinities

#### Affinity for Fauna
You have a connection to the animals of the world, both alive and dead, and can call on their power and wisdom to aid you in your adventures.

|  7  | *Phantom Steed*, *Speak with Plants* |

##### Wisdom of the Past
Also at 3rd level, you can call of the wisdom of those that trod before you. Whenever you make a Skill Check, you gain a bonus to the result equal to your Wisdom modifier. If the skill already uses your Wisdom modifier, you still get this bonus.

##### Animal Memory
At 7th level, when you create a Totem by expending a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you may choose to cast *Summon Beast* at the level of the expended spell slot. Instead of creating a Totem as normal, the summoned beast carries the properties of the Totem. If the beast dies, the Totem appears in its place. You do not need to concentrate on *Summon Beast* if cast this way.

#### Affinity for the Heavens
Long have you studied the constellations, and seen how they guide the world as though they were the deities from the heavens above. Using this knowledge, you can steer yourself and your companions down the right path.

As you gain levels in this class, you know the following spells. These spells do not count against your total spells known.
| Shaman Level  | Spells |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  3  | *Identify*, *Bless* |
|  5  | *Moonbeam*, *Locate Object* |
|  7  | *Blink*, *Clairvoyance* |

##### Totem of Guidance

\pagebreakNum

##### Extreme Conditions
At 7th level your will grows even stronger. Each time you make a damage roll, you may add your Charisma Modifier to the damage rolled for each die rolled. When you do, you cannot use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

## Iconic Creatures

### Ekindra Feyheart
Orignally a Gall from Focura, Ekindra joined the Oest Expeditions as an accomplished artificer. Her skills were quickly recognised, and she rose through the ranks until she was given the ultimate position of Director of the Oestern Trading Company, overseeing both its function, and the major port town of Safe Haven.

Many have tried to usurp her, and though a few on occasion succeed, she always finds her way back to the top.
### Ignis, Revolutionary
Ignis was born as an inauspicious Ra-Khel, and choose exile when he came of age. Tinkering with lodestones led him into the skills of artifice, and after travelling and honing his skills he returned to Khel-Ak Ra, aiming to bring about change and justice for those deemed "inauspicious". Now he leads a significant revolutionary faction, in tentatively peaceful protests and civil discussions with the destiny weavers.
### Pyre Rat
A pirate from the Storm Islands, Pyre Rat got his name for his love of burning things. A charismatic scoundrel, he and his accomplices found themselves stranded in Hellspire, where they now fulfill odd jobs and frequent taverns as often as they can.
### Sai Lore
Sai arrived in Hellspire alongside Pyre, and quickly got to work getting materials to improve his firearms with. After a Topaz dragon was felled in the city, he acquired some of the scales, and developed a menacing new weapon.
### Crazy "Cray Ken" Kenneth
Kenneth almost drowned back in the Storm Islands, but was saved by what he describes as "The Cray". Most take this to mean crayfish, but some wonder if it's the remnants of The Kraken or its offspring granting Kenneth his newfound powers. Kenneth unfortunately acquried a severe anxiety and stutter from this incident, which he is yet to recover from. Now he resides in Hellspire, although most of his free time is spent at home in safety.
### Metallic Dragonlords
The Metallic Dragonlords of the Great Realms - and Hellspire, each have their own strengths, but they all share a common source of power in their mother, The Platinum Lady.
### Dread Toad, Lick
The Dread Toad hails from the Bilencaus bogs, where he was able to slowly amass his power, luring in strangers with his croaks. Now he has become all powerful, standing proudly above his empire of obsidian.
### Zarola Trespire
Zarola rules with an iron fist, and several magical blades. A newcomer to hell, she’s quickly cemented her place as one of the most wrathful mortals to claim a Daearchy
### Infernal Furnace
The death cloud of smog rolls across the hellscape, feeding on anything foolish enough to be in its path. Inside lurks a secret, an Infernal Furnace spewing the smog as a cloak. The furnace seems to be its own master, with a mind of its own.
### Clunk
The death cloud of smog rolls across the hellscape, feeding on anything foolish enough to be in its path. Inside lurks a secret, a dark forge spewing the smog as a cloak. The forge seems to be its own master, with a mind of its own.
### Amordeus
Amordeus is a Hell born demon, powerful and filled with lust for life, and most things living it. His harem, a collection of every devilish fiend or mortal that is lured to his palace, spends far too much time *together* to be worried about conquest.

\pagebreakNum

### Thy Purity
Originally from the Heavenly planes, Thy Purity grew envious of those on other planes, especially the raw power found down in Hell. Possessing great strength himself, he managed to split his physical form between both planes, receiving both blessings and curses of both. He regrets nothing and considers his form one of the most divine.

He still resides also in the Heavenly Plane, and represents the Virtuoso of Purity. His split across planes is not well known amongst the beings in the Heavenly Plane, and he makes sure it stays that way.

### Bobby
Bobby comes from another time, a place beyond veils. Cursed with never ending talent and ease, he also knows exactly how most things go in these situations. His complete apathy to trying to change the world led him to just let things happen, and those in hell were waiting excitedly when he finally arrived. No one greeted him though, that’s going a bit far…

\pagebreakNum

### Raúl, Son of Amordeus
Raúl is a son of Amordeus, although unlike his father, he aligns more closely with Pride, and takes its benefits. He carries with him Skullcrusher, a gift from the Wrath Daearch, after beating them in many "friendly" competiions. Alongside Skullcrusher, Raúl carries a barbed whip set in eternal flame.

He is filled with aspirations to fulfill his highest potentional that he feels his sister, Insome, should share. To this end, he has tried countless ploys to get her to see that there is no shying away from who she is, even going so far as to disguise himself as lowly mortals on the physical plane.

### Insom
Insom is Raúl's sister, although she is more mortal than he is, and aligns closely with Sloth - not out of laziness, but of fear of becoming the demonic tyrant and force of chaos that she sees her brother as. Her father, Amordeus, has pushed her towards achieving her own goals at her own pace, but he spends the majority of his time in his chambers anyway, not interfering too much in his spawns' doings.

Insom is a talented illusionist, specialising in those spells that hide her true form, and altering others' perceptions of herself.

In a combat situation, she is more likely to run, or de-escalate, but will fight if need be, finally letting her father's power flow through her.

# The Heem Ho Goblins Mystery
## Stuck in the Bilencaus
This module is designed for four level 3 adventurers. It assumes the party will remain level 3 throughout. If used in a larger campaign, award enough experience for each adventurer to reach level 4 upon completion of the adventure. It is recommended to read through the entire adventure prior to running it.
<br>
<br>
*In the putrid bogs of the Bilencaus, the air is thick with toxic gases that exude from the constantly decaying wildlife. Few creatures survive outside of natural havens of rock, or purpose built settlements. Those that do survive pose a serious threat to anyone foolish enough to venture unprotected.*

*As such, anyone wishing to travel through the Bilencaus must do so with barrels of air, or magical enchantments to assist in breathing. Barrels are much cheaper than wizards, and so groups of travellers often make the journey together.*

*For one reason or another, each of the adventurers finds themselves in a land caravan on its way through the Bilencaus, towards the habitable lands to the north. The journey is split halfway by a refill stop at Heem-Ho, a predominantly goblin settlement, where they mine pockets of breathable air from the rocks.*

*The caravan will stop here for a few days, to allow people to recover and breathe air that isn't from a barrel. But trouble is brewing in the town, as fewer people leave than enter...*

### Caravan Ride
The players start in a caravan headed for the city of Murkwater. The caravan is low on barreled air, and must stop off at Heem Ho, a Goblin mining town where they mine pockets of untainted air.

Allow the players to introduce themselves as they wish, and once introductions are complete, have a caravan supervisor pass their carriage and mention that they're closing in on Heem Ho. As the supervisor wanders off, have them let out a cry of alarm as they notify of incoming monsters.

### Poison Dart "Frogs"
The party may decide to react, helping the supervisor, or attempt to escape. If they can do so convincingly, allow them to progress to Heem Ho, mentioning how most of the caravan seems to perish at the hands of toxic Frog-People known as Bog Rana.

If they fail to escape, or choose to help, they enter combat against 3 or 4 *Bog Rana*, perhaps with a friendly human supervisor.

The combat area need not have too much scenery involved, perhaps an overturned carriage or area of swampy debris.

### Heem Ho
*The town of Heem Ho is fortified with a wooden palisade, wrapped in a magic bubble to keep contaminated air out. The design is common in the Bilencaus, and does enough - with guards - to keep monsters out and protect the townsfolk.*

*Most of the townsfolk are Goblins, but they are friendly in the region, and know they have a good economic position. The town is as one would expect, although many doors only reach 5.5 foot high instead of the normal 6-7.*

Once the Party has made it to Heem Ho, along with any other survivors from the caravan, they will be ushered inside by some Goblin guards, and pointed toward the nearby tavern, *The Leaky Keg* to recuperate. On their way to the tavern, inform the character with the highest perception that they see a coughing woman - another survivor from the caravan - by some barrels, and some goblins dressed in medic attire. They may choose to investigate.

#### Coughing Woman
*The coughing woman is not particularly old, nor frail, and yet she has quite a cough. The two goblin medics next to her seem increasingly concerned as she keeps coughing.*
If the party decides to investigate the coughing woman, she will reveal that she was indeed in the caravan, and managed to run to Heem Ho without being caught by the Bog Rana. Out of breath, and spluttering slightly from Bilencaus gas, she headed for the emergency air. However, unlike normal, her cough has not subsided.

\pagebreakNum

If the party stays and questions the lady and goblins for long enough, they will get increasingly concerned that the woman keeps coughing. Eventually, the woman will drop unconcious, and be escorted in a panic away by the goblins, leaving the air barrels unattended.

#### Air Barrels
*A small open entrance marquee with medicinal symbols sits near the entrance to town. A rest stop for those in desperate need of clean air,1 or suffering from Bog Blight from their travels. Several goblins in medic outfits tend to those in need.*

If a character takes a breath from the emergency air barrels, they must make a DC 10 Constitution Saving Throw. On a failure, they will start coughing, and are poisoned for the next minute. Repeated breaths and fails of this Save whilst poisoned will result in 1d4 Poison damage on each failure.

The air barrels are not marked in any way, aside from charcoaled-on labels saying "**EMERGENCY AIR**". Any queries about where the barrels come from will reveal that the miner's office is the place to go.


#### The Leaky Keg
*A jovial atmosphere permeates the tavern. A good mix of Human, Rana, and Goblinoids make up the majority of the patrons.*

If the Party get to *The Leaky Keg*, they will be able to overhear or ask about happenings in town. Describe a few suspect tavern dwellers, and if a character asks them for information, have them react accordingly - either willing to give info, or reserved before a successful persuasion check or bribery. If no characters directly ask about happenings, have them overhear a fervant discussion or similar in a corner of the tavern.

In either case, amongst regular mundane information, the party will hear that:

*There's recently been new leadership in town, as the prior goblin mayor has been replaced by a new human mayor, from Murkwater, who intends to reduce the cost of the air, at the expense of Heem Ho's treasury. This has been received in mixed manners by the townsfolk, but more negatively from the native goblins, especially the elderly.*

Give out this information as appropriate for how the players learn about it - overhearing snippets will reveal less than a drunk explaining the whole thing.

#### The Mayor of Heem Ho
*The new mayor of Heem Ho is a human named Dereth. He appears lanky and young, with bright eyes and a knowing smile. Words flow from his mouth as though he believes them, and he is known to talk about his dreams of restoring clean air to the Bilencaus.*

The mayor can be found in the town hall, talking with peers. If questioned, he will confirm his plan to sell under rate for a few months, using the goodwill to fund further development and other air mines about the area. He will mention that there did seem to be some dissatisfaction amongst some goblins who'd expected the old mayor to remain in office.

Any inquiry from the party - to the mayor or his colleagues - should be met with reassurance that he is genuine in his goals, but not unaware that they are controversial. Some may suggest that talking with the miners in their office might be a way to judge their opinion.

#### The Miner's Office
*A surprisingly well kept office. The miners here don't seem too covered in rock dust, with their outer clothing placed somewhat neatly in a pile near the door. A few desks, barrels, and other bureaucratic devices scatter the room. The chief mining officer sits at their desk, near the back of the single room.*

Despite a general friendly disposition, the regular miners will refuse much conversation, instead directing the party toward the chief officer.

The chief officer will receive the party kindly, and happily answer what questions they may have. If questioned about the dissent amongst the goblins, they will express concern but assure the party they are handling internal conflicts.

A **DC 13 Insight** skill check will reveal that the officer does not fully believe they are handling the conflicts very well.


> ##### Answering Questions
> * Many questions will effectively be for descriptive purposes only, so feel free to improvise details about trade, relations with Murkwater, or even other towns in the area.

After an amount of time spent talking with the officer, or when the party are about to leave, an interruption occurs:

*A medic goblin runs in the doorway and collapses, gasping for air. He desperately waves a piece of paper at the party and chief officer. Before he can do anything else, he wheezes and faints.*

#### Mystery Note
*Scrawled drawings and writing in Goblin mark this paper. What looks to be a cave system is drawn out, with arrows pointing to what seems like an ordinary wall on the map...*

The piece of paper in the medic's hand appears to be a map, with notes scrawled in Goblin. If no one in the party can read Goblin, the chief officer will translate. It mentions a secret tunnel, with the words "**BAD AIR**" next to it.

The chief officer will ask the adventuring party if they could investigate, for a small reward of 250g, and free air whenever they visit Heem Ho or its suppliers. The chief officer will provide an official seal to allow the party passage through the mine.

If the party agrees, the chief officer will send a miner with them to escort them to the "secret" tunnel, but from there they're on their own.

\pagebreak

#### The Mine
*Grey stone and red lamps line this mine. The dim light guides the way through various tunnels, showing the correct way to go. Old tunnels are sealed with wooden barriers, their air pockets exhausted. Other tunnels hum with the whir of air extraction machinery. Trekking further into the caves leaves greater confusion over which way you arrived. Best hope the guide is still here when you return...*

The mine is made up of several caverns, in which extraction tools are affixed to the walls. The guide miner should lead the party to the secret tunnel marked upon the map, and assure them that they will wait outside. No amount of persuasion will change their mind, as they will insist if something happens to them, they won't be able to guide the party out.

The general overview of the Mine is shown in the "Air Mining Caverns - Secret Area" map.

##### Room A
*Behind a wooden barricade lies a small tunnel, leading through to a surprisingly well hewn out cavern. The hum of extraction tools tell you that air is being barreled nearby. It also makes it harder to hear if there's anyone about.*

Behind a few pillars lurks two *Goblin Ruffians*. They will fight if they notice the party. If the party chooses to spare them in any manner, they will fearfully reveal that the goblin in charge is in the back-most room (D).

#### Room B
*Noise in this room informs you of several air extraction tools being used. Even from the doorway, you can spot two. Next to them are more ruffians. It's unlikely you can persuade them to stop, although perhaps if you knock a couple of them out, they might concede defeat.*

# A traipse in the Hellscape
## Plot of the Daearchs
This module is designed for four level 9 adventurers. It has expectations that the party will gradually reach level 14 by the end of the adventure. Narrative milestones will be marked at the end of the introduction, but the module lends itself well to experience based leveling too. It is recommended to read through the sections *'Hellish Boons'* and *'The Daearchs and their realms'* in depth, as well as a basic read through the rest of the module, prior to running it.

<br>

*In the fiery depths of the Infernal Plane lies the Hellscape, home to the seven Daearchs of Sin. Each embodies its sin, and watches over a small kingdom within the Hellscape.*

*Deaearchs are not eternal in their reign, and as such, the Daearch of Wrath has recently been usurped by a newcomer, a Tiefling by the name of Zarola. Even as the Hellscape prepares to adjust for this shift in politics, a sinister plot has begun to unfold, threatening to break the limitations on Fiends and allow them free reign in the Physical Plane.*

*A daughter of Lust, Insom, has found out about this plot, and has approached four heroes in her Tiefling form, asking that they help prevent what could be chaos...*

## Preparations
Before starting the adventure, the players have several decisions to make. You may choose to play these choices out in character, or decide in advance.

Insom will take the heroes through to the Hellscape - with no guarantee of return. However, before they do so, each hero must align themselves with a sin, in order to avoid immediate detection by the daearchs as imposters. Insom carries with her only a single totem of each sin, and so the heroes cannot choose the same sin. Each alignment grants the hero the respective Hellish Boon shown in *'Hellish Boons'*.

In addition, Insom will offer a choice to the heroes of where to start in the Hellscape. She will offer two options:
* Lust's Domain
* Sloth's Domain

She will explain that these two domains are the least hostile to oustiders and non-fiends.

Upon arriving at their chosen domain, Insom will take the heroes to see the sitting daearch. It is recommended that in-character play begins at this point.


\columnbreak

> ### Hellish Boons
>The Daearchs of the Hellscape imbue power to those that follow them. There are several ways to acquire these boons, including ritual spells or icons and totems of Hellish power. Once a character has adopted one of these boons, they cannot lose or change their boon. The Daearch of their boon may see fit to remove it for them.
Boons are not lost upon death.
>#### Pride
>Sets AC to 25. When hit and damaged by an enemy attack, lose this bonus and future attacks have +2 to hit against you. Resets after a short rest.
>#### Wrath
>Roll an additional die of damage on each hit.
>Whenever you make an attack, you go blind. You can only see yourself, the 5ft space you occupy, and the target of your attack. This effect ends if you take the disengage action or you reduce a creature to 0 hit points.
>#### Gluttony
>Whenever you make an Initiative roll, you gain Level/CR x 2 temporary hit points.
>Your speed is reduced by 10 whilst you have these temporary hit points.
>#### Avarice
>You must take an additional action on your turn. This action may only be used to attack or cast a cantrip.
>Whenever you take an Action, Bonus Action, or Reaction, take 1 damage.
>#### Lust
>Whenever you make an Initiative Roll, choose an enemy creature. Both you and that creature are Charmed by each other until one is reduced to 0 hit points.
>#### Envy
>Whenever a creature within 60ft becomes the target of a spell or ability of one of its allies, you also gain the effects of that spell or ability.
>Whenever one or more creatures within 60ft fails a Saving Throw, you suffer the same effects as they do, if possible.
>#### Sloth
>Whenever you succeed an Ability Check, Saving Throw, or Attack Roll, you gain Disadvantage on your next Ability Check, Saving Throw, or Attack Roll for 10 minutes.
>Whenever you fail an Ability Check, Saving Throw, or Attack Roll, you gain Advantage on your next Ability Check, Saving Throw, or Attack Roll for 10 minutes.

## The Daearchs and their realms
The Hellscape is the infernal plane, where fiends originate and reside. For most of their time, fiends - at least the ones that can think for themselves - live in settlements spread out across the vast landscape.

Lava flows and volcanic geysers litter the Hellscape, and the less group inclined fiends roam freely between settlements.

In the Hellscape rule seven Daearchs, each one personifying a sin of the sapient. Each Daearch imbues those that congregate around it with their own boon of power, that cannot be removed except by that Daearch.

To become a Daearch, one must closely align with the sin it represents, and kill the current Daearch.


### Pride
#### Daearch - The Dread Toad, Lick
The Dread Toad hails from the Bilencaus bogs, where he was able to slowly amass his power, luring in strangers with his croaks. Now he has become all powerful, standing proudly above his empire of obsidian.

His city reflects his pride, with statues and constructs dedicated to his glory. His servants gladly create these for him - as well as their own for themselves. The centre of the city is dedicated to Lick, with a great raised platform adorned in art that pleases him, and in the middle he sits, that he may look upon all he rules as it surrounds him.

### Wrath
#### Daearch - Zarola Trespire
Zarola rules with an iron fist, and several magical blades. A newcomer to hell, she’s quickly cemented her place as one of the most wrathful mortals to claim a Daearchy.

Her city is currently being torn down and rebuilt, replacing that of the daearch before her. Looming spires have begun to rise, but for the most part scaffolding covers the majority of her city.

### Gluttony
#### Daearch - Death Cloud
The death cloud of smog rolls across the hellscape, feeding on anything foolish enough to be in its path.
Inside lurks a secret, a dark forge spewing the smog as a cloak. The forge seems to be its own master, with a mind of its own.

### Avarice
#### Daearch - Clunk
Clunk was a gnome who fell a little too far. Landing in Hell, she rapidly assimilated by losing parts of her mortal form, replacing them with obsidian prosthetics. She now almost never sleeps, greedy for more and more time each day with which to tinker and upgrade herself even more.

### Lust
#### Daearch - Amordeus
Amordeus is a Hell born demon, powerful and filled with lust for life, and most things living it. His harem, a collection of every devilish fiend or mortal that is lured to his palace, spends far too much time *together* to be worried about conquest.

### Envy
#### Daearch - Thy Purity
Originally from the Heavenly planes, Thy Purity grew envious of those on other planes, especially the raw power found down in Hell. Possessing great strength himself, he managed to split his physical form between both planes, receiving both blessings and curses of both. He regrets nothing and considers his form one of the most divine.
### Sloth
#### Daearch - Bobby
Bobby comes from another time, a place beyond veils. Cursed with never ending talent and ease, he also knows exactly how most things go in these situations. His complete apathy to trying to change the world led him to just let things happen, and those in hell were waiting excitedly when he finally arrived. No one greeted him though, that’s going a bit far…
