      <h1>Puff Pastry Vegetable Tart</h1>
      <p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2><br>

        1 x 500 g block of ready-made puff pastry<br>
        plain flour , for dusting<br>
        4 teaspoons pesto<br>
        1 handful of mixed, ripe cherry tomatoes<br>
        8 asparagus spears<br>
        4 baby courgettes<br>
        2-3 jarred roasted peppers<br>
        ½ a bunch of fresh basil<br>
        olive oil<br>
        8 black olives , optional<br>
        1 x 100 g ball mozzarella<br>
        20 g Parmesan cheese , optional<br>


      </p>
      <p>
        Turn on the oven to 200ºC/gas 6. Carefully cut the pastry block in half with a table knife. Wrap the other half and refrigerate or freeze for later.<br><br>
        Dust some flour onto a clean work surface and, using a rolling pin, roll out the pastry into a square, measuring 26cm x 26cm. Cut into 4 equal squares.<br><br>
        Place the pastry squares on a baking tray, leaving a space between each.<br><br>
        Using the back of a spoon, spread the centre of each square with pesto, but don’t spread it onto the edges.<br><br>
        Squash the tomatoes into a large mixing bowl, then snap the asparagus spears into 3cm pieces. Keep the lovely pointy tips and a little of the stalk, but discard the end 3cm.<br><br>
        Using a speed peeler, carefully shred the courgettes into ribbons. Tear the roasted peppers into strips and add to the bowl.<br><br>
        Pick the basil leaves, reserving the pretty ones for later. Place the large ones in the mixing bowl.<br><br>
        Mix the vegetables together in the bowl, adding a splash of oil. Pile a little of the mixture on each pesto-smeared tart and top with two olives (if using).<br><br>
        Break up the mozzarella and place little bits on top of each tart – this will make it gooey like a pizza. Grate over some Parmesan (if using).<br><br>
        Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until the pastry is golden and the cheese is all bubbly.<br><br>
        Once the tarts are ready, allow to cool slightly. Sprinkle with the reserved basil leaves and serve with a nice salad for lunch.<br><br>
